It might also interest you to know that there used to be a village called Indarpat in the very place where the original Indraprastha was supposed to be located. The village Indarpat remained until the beginning of the twentieth century. It was demolished along with many other villages when the British capital of New Delhi came to be built. An inscription in Sanskrit found near the original Indarpat mentions Indraprastha. The inscription is now in the Red Fort Museum.


Pandavas (who were the legitimate heirs) asked for five villages for themselves. The names of these five villages end with pat (the Hindi equivalent of Sanskrit prastha). They were Indarpat, Baghpat, Tilpat, Sonepat, and Panipat.


For some strange reason kings belonging to different dynasties (or sometimes from the same dynasty, as in the case of the Tughluqs) who came to Delhi preferred to build their own capital in a different part of the city rather than reside and renovate the existing capital. When shifting to another location they often demolished the existing buildings and used up the material for building new ones.

Din-e-panah, the sixth city, is better known as the Purana Qila. It was begun by the Mughal Emperor Humayun and completed by Sher Shah around 1533.


Shah Jahan decided to build his new capital at Delhi, complete with citadel and a royal residential complex. “Delhi has been the capital of Hindustan from time immemorial,” he wrote in his memoir as he finalized his plan, “It shall again be the seat of the Mughal Empire. Here I shall raise a mighty fort which will be the envy, of our friends and the despair of our foes.”


The six main palaces were built just behind the Diwan-i-Am. Only five of these palaces remain now. The first is the Mumtaz Mahal. The building is now the Delhi Museum of Archaeology, which is known for its rare Mughal exhibits.


The new city was seven miles in circumference. It was surrounded on three sides with a high and massive wall that had a broad parapet.


Princess Jahan Ara, Shah Jahan’s favourite daughter, laid out the Urdu Bazar near the Jama Masjid. She also built a large chowk with a big pool at the centre, which came to be known as the Chandni Chowk.
