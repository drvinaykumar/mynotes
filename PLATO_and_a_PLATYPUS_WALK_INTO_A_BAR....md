Achilles and the tortoise? Naturally, Achilles can run faster than the tortoise, so the tor toise is given a big head start. At the gun—or as they said in the fifth century b.c., at the javelin—Achilles’s first goal is to get to the point where the tortoise started. Of course, by then the tortoise has moved a little way. So now Achilles has to get to that spot. By the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved again. No matter how many times Achilles reaches the tor toise ’s prior location, even if he does it an infinite number of times, Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise, although he ’ll get awfully close. All the tortoise needs to do to win the race is to not to stop.

A man is worried that his wife is losing her hearing, so he consults a doctor.

Ten feet behind her, he repeats, “What’s for dinner tonight?” Still no answer. Finally, right behind her he says, “What’s for dinner tonight?” And his wife turns around and says, “For the third time— chicken!”
