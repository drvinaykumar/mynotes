Ibn Sina,

Ibn Sina, Biruni, Khwarazmi, Farabi, Ghazali,


The construction by poet Omar Khayyam (yes, the poet!) of a geo- metrical theory of cubic equations was a genuine breakthrough, as was his extension of arithmetical language to ratios. Khayyam was the first to identify and classify the fourteen types of third- degree equations and to propose geometric proofs for many that had previously confounded ex- perts. He was also among the first, if not the first, to accept irrational num- bers as numbers. In attempting to prove Euclid’s axiom that parallel lines cannot meet, he produced a new theory of parallels. Two Soviet historians of science concluded that some of the propositions derived by Khayyam in his theory of parallels were “essential y the same as the first theorems of the non- Euclidean geometries of Lobachevski and Riemann,”10 both of whom, it should be noted, lived seven hundred years after 


Rashid al- Din, to write the world’s first universal history.13


Biruni,


It is no exaggeration to say that Biruni was the greatest social scientist between Thucydides and modern times.


Farabi, who was called “the second teacher” after Aristotle and who, with Ibn Sina, achieved what many considered to be a harmonious blend of reason and revelation, logic and metaphysics, Aristotle and the Neoplatonists.17
