fallacy: Teaching does not necessarily, or even usually, lead to learning. In order to learn something, one has to be willing and eager to absorb it, to make it part of one’s store of knowledge.


Russell Ackoff was wont to say: in a standard educational setting, the only person who learns is the teacher, who is always motivated to understand the material s/he is called on to explain.


Teacher training has it all backwards. Its main focus is on trying to show prospective teachers how to get students to learn stuff they don’t want to learn—an activity called “pedagogy”.


While we’re on the topic of “subjects”, it is worth noting that the present general division of human knowledge into “subjects”—math, logic, physics, biology, rhetoric, etc.—was first made by students at Aristotle’s “Walk-around School” (a.k.a. “The Peripatetic School”) some 2400 years ago. Some of them took notes and, to organize those notes and the ideas they had absorbed from their conversations, they labeled them with names that later became memorialized as “subject areas”.


fallacy: Just ask yourself a simple question: when you think about a problem—any problem—do you first say to yourself, “What subject area does this problem fall into?”, or do you search for anything you know that can help you solve the problem? In real life, “subjects” are a useless detour on the path to wisdom.


fallacy: Over 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, a careful and thoughtful observer, proclaimed that the key feature of the world around him could be summarized in a simple phrase: “All Is Change”. It is a refrain heard more frequently than any other nowadays. Change in every walk of life is accelerating at a dizzying pace, and no one can predict what will be important and relevant when the child of today becomes the adult of tomorrow. The only sure thing—and students all know this—is that the current state of knowledge in any domain will not remain unchanged in the future.  

Notes: 1) And thus it is more important to learn how to learn then focusing on one thing . 


The fact that the human species could not have survived, as it did, for over 200,000 years without schools should be sufficient evidence that children have inborn drives and abilities to mature into successfully functioning adults without the intervention of a formal educational structure dedicated to directing their lives.


when going to science lab, be aware that there is a right answer known in advance by your teacher, and you are going to be judged by how close you got to the right answer. So much for asking Nature a question


when going to science lab, be aware that there is a right answer known in advance by your teacher, and you are going to be judged by how close you got to the right answer. So much for asking Nature a question and receiving the answer directly.

So much for asking Nature a question and receiving the answer directly. Not only is science lab a fraud, bearing no relation to what professionals do, but students learn that science is an exercise in getting the answer that the authorities in the field have approved.
