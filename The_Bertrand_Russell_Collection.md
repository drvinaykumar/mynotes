Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This

the distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they are.


Descartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a method which may still be used with profit—the method of systematic doubt.


If the cloth completely hides the table, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if the table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and the cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in the place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.


The faculty of being acquainted with things other than itself is the main characteristic of a mind.


The word 'German' will, again, have different meanings for different people. To some it will recall travels in Germany, to some the look of Germany on the map, and so on. But if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable, we shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a particular with which we are acquainted. Such reference is involved in any mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite dates), or of here and there, or of what others have told


The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.


(1) The law of identity: 'Whatever is, is.' (2) The law of contradiction: 'Nothing can both be and not be.' (3) The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be.'


His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. He pointed out, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the idea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them together.


It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one word which denotes a universal. The nearest approach would be some such statement as 'I like this'. But even here the word 'like' denotes a universal, for I may like other things, and other people may like things. Thus all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals.


In regard to one man's knowledge at a given time, universals, like particulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those known only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or by description.


The easiest relations to apprehend are those which hold between the different parts of a single complex sense-datum.

Another relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is resemblance.


Metaphysics, or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means of thought, has been developed, from the first, by the union and conflict of two very different human impulses, the one urging men towards mysticism, the other urging them towards science.


Heraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in universal flux: time builds and destroys all things.


Heraclitus to assert the identity of opposites: "Good and ill are one," he says; and again: "To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right."


"It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul"; and again: "Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things."


if all is one, the distinction of past and future must be illusory.
