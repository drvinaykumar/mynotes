When you tell them about a new friend, they never question you about what's important. They never tell you, "What is the sound of his voice, what games he prefers, does he collect butterflies?" They ask you, "How old is he, how many brothers does he have, how much does he earn, how much does his father earn?" Only then do they think they know him.
