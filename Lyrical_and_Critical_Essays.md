The people I have loved have always been better and greater than I.


By ignoring compliments and homages we lead the person paying those compliments to think we look down on him, when in fact we are only doubting ourselves.


Perhaps there is a lot of that churlish pride of mine here, whose strength and extent I know only too well.
