« How much you know in the broad sense determines what you understand of the new things you learn. » Hilde Østby and Ylva Østby 1


« The more moving parts you have in something, the more possibilities there are. » Adam Frank


But most real-world systems are more apt to experience dynamic equilibrium, meaning things fluctuate within a particular range.


Kongo Gumi. A construction company specializing in high-quality Buddhist temples, it operated independently from 578 AD to 2006. Today it exists as a subsidiary of a larger company. At the time of Kongo Gumi’s liquidation, it was the oldest company in the world, having built Japan’s first-ever Buddhist temple. Throughout the entirety of that time, it remained in the hands of the same family—40 generations of them.


difference between medicine and poison is in the dose. Too much of a beneficial substance can be harmful or lethal, and a tiny amount of a harmful substance can have beneficial effects.


Our ego gets in the way of capitalizing on the margin of safety that is produced by knowing more than you need to. Often we learn enough to solve today’s problem but not enough to solve tomorrow’s. There is no margin of safety in what we know. Another way our ego gets in the way is that we tend to coast on our natural strengths, too afraid or intimidated to dive into being the worst at something. But as Hadfield explains, “Early success is a terrible teacher. You’re essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can’t do it. You don’t know how.”


Within systems, components are constantly wearing out and getting used up. This includes both the material and information (the stocks) within a system and the parts of the system itself. Keeping a system functioning requires ongoing replenishing of both the stocks and the parts used to maintain them.


Within systems, components are constantly wearing out and getting used up. This includes both the material and information (the stocks) within a system and the parts of the system itself. Keeping a system functioning requires ongoing replenishing of both the stocks and the parts used to maintain them. We call this process of attrition “churn.”


Part of what made Bourbaki such a revolutionary collective was its insistence that members churn at regular intervals. This ensured an inflow of new perspectives and knowledge.


Using the lens of churn on the story of Bourbaki demonstrates there can be value in constant change. Harnessed and directed appropriately, churn brings in new ideas and increases our adaptability. It’s what allows for evolution by selecting for beneficial traits.


« “Algorithm” is arguably the single most important concept in our world. If we want to understand our life and our future, we should make every effort to understand what an algorithm is, and how algorithms are connected with emotions. An algorithm is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems, and reach decisions. An algorithm isn’t a particular calculation, but the method followed when making the calculation. » Yuval Noah Harari 1 Algorithms


Moving beyond computers, all systems need algorithms to function: sets of instructions for adapting to and solving problems. Increasingly, algorithms are designed to be directionally correct over perfect. They often evolve—or are designed—to get useful and relevant enough outputs to keep the system functioning properly. Neither nature nor humans worry about producing algorithms that produce the most optimal outputs 100% of the time. When we look at a system, it’s useful to consider the underlying instructions dictating its behavior in order to determine how to intervene to improve it.


The pirates who survived the longest and became the richest during the heyday of piracy did so by following rigid rules underscored in many cases by something a lot like a constitution, known as articles, as Peter T. Leeson explains in The Invisible Hook. 7


Looking at how pirate leaders like Ching Shih managed to lead large numbers of pirates in high-stakes situations teaches us how algorithms can ensure cohesion within systems. For a system to produce its intended output, the goals of its parts need to be aligned in the same direction. This increases the chances of consistently achieving a predictable outcome. Controlling


Space alone does not create this environment. An overly large square can actively repel people as it feels overexposed and empty. A popular one must have enough activity and reasons to visit in a small enough space to create the density needed for spontaneous and ongoing interactions to occur.


As Aristotle put it thousands of years ago, “The whole is something over and above its parts, and not just the sum of them all.”


We cannot understand systems with emergent properties by reducing them to their components. Termite mounds exhibit emergent properties. A single termite is powerless, but a million or two working together can build a complex mound up to 17 feet tall, requiring the movement of a ton of soil and several tons of water each year. 3 Without a leader orchestrating their movements, termites build ventilation and cooling systems, storage chambers, fungal

you don’t always need to plan things all the way to the end. If you have a simple starting point on the right trajectory, surprising things can pan out through the power of emergence.


Joseph Henrich *, in The Secret of Our Success, explains that “the striking technologies that characterize our species, from the kayaks and compound bows used by hunter-gatherers to the antibiotics and airplanes of the modern world, emerge not from singular geniuses but from the flow and recombination of ideas, practices, lucky errors, and chance insights among interconnected minds and across generations.” 16 Basically humans create things as a group that no one person is capable of.


Relatively small improvements are easier than large ones, so most successful innovations will lead to small changes. These modest attempts at improvement give behaviors a nudge in an adaptive direction, on average.
