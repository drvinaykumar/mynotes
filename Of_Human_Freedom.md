What is the downside for those who refuse to accept it? To be just as they are. [22] Is someone unhappy being alone? Leave him to his isolation. Is someone unhappy with his parents? Let him be a bad son, and grumble. Is someone unhappy with his children? Let him be a bad father. [23] ‘Throw him in jail.’ What jail? The one he is in already, since he is there against his will; and if he is there against his will then he is imprisoned. Conversely, Socrates was not in prison because he chose to be there.


You ought to realize, you take up very little space in the world as a whole– your body, that is; in reason, however, you yield to no one, not even to the gods, because reason is not measured in size but sense.


The gods have released you from accountability for your parents, your siblings, your body, your possessions– for death and for life itself. [34] They made you responsible only for what is in your power– the proper use of impressions. [35] So why take on the burden of matters which you cannot answer for? You are only making unnecessary problems for yourself.


Reputation was the empty noise of fools.


just remember what belongs to you, and you won’t lay claim to what doesn’t.


Is there smoke in the house? If it’s not suffocating, I will stay indoors; if it proves too much, I’ll leave. Always remember– the door is open.


‘You threaten me with death, but nature threatens you.’


If I cherish my body, I make a slave of myself, if I cherish my property, I make a slave of myself; [24] because I’ve disclosed the means to make me captive. When a snake pulls back its head, right away I think, ‘Hit it just there, on the part that it’s protecting.’ In the same way you may be sure that whatever you are seen to protect, that will become your enemy’s focus of attack. [25] Keep this in mind, then there will be no one you will need to fear or flatter.


That is what Socrates practised, maintaining always the same even temper. But it seems that we would practise and study anything rather than how to remain free and unenslaved.


‘Be confident in everything outside the will, and cautious in everything under the will’s control.’


Socrates used to call such fears ‘hobgoblins’, and rightly so; just as masks scare and frighten children since they haven’t seen them before, we react to events in much the same way and for much the same reason.


‘But wasn’t Socrates a writer, and a prolific one at that?’ Yes, but for what purpose? Since there wasn’t always someone available whose ideas he could examine or who could examine Socrates’ own in turn, sometimes he would test and examine himself, forever subjecting to scrutiny one assumption or another.


sometimes he would test and examine himself, forever subjecting to scrutiny one assumption or another. [33] That’s the writing of a real philosopher;


Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received – and the latter lies outside his control.


We agonize over our body, our money, or what the emperor is going to decree – never about anything inside us. I mean, do we worry whether we are going to make an error in judgement? No, because it is under our control. Or having an unnatural urge? No again.


As long as you have this attachment to the body, be ready to submit to anyone or anything of superior physical force.


‘A fool cannot be convinced or even compelled to renounce his folly.’


The same problem occurs in the conduct of life. ‘Good’, ‘bad’, ‘useful’, ‘harmful’– these words are part of everyone’s vocabulary, we all have a preconception of what they signify. But is it developed and complete? [11] Prove it– apply it correctly to particular things. Now Plato, for his part, associates definitions with his preconception of what is ‘useful’; you, however, categorize them as useless. [12] Both of you cannot be right. Some people associate the idea of the good with wealth, or pleasure, or health; others plainly do not. [13] Because if all of us who use these words are not just blowing smoke, and we don’t need help clarifying their preconceptions, why is there any misunderstanding, conflict or blame on either side? [14] But why refer to conflict between different people, and bring up that? Just take yourself– if you are good at applying your preconceptions, why are you internally conflicted and confused?


don’t want anything except what God wants, and no one will stop or stay you, any more than they can stand in the way of God.


When you have him as your leader, and conform your will and desire to his, what fear of failure can you have?


But please stop representing yourself as a philosopher, you affected fool! You still experience envy, pity, jealousy and fear, and hardly a day passes that you don’t whine to the gods about your life. [27] Some philosopher! You learned syllogisms and changing arguments. Good, now try unlearning them, if you can, and make a fresh start. Wake up to the fact that so far you have barely touched the subject.


‘To me those other things are worthless; it’s enough if one day I can live without sorrow and frustration, if I can lift up my head like a free person in the face of circumstance and look to heaven as a friend of God, without fear of anything that might happen.’


And if you’re laid up a mere ten days, when you get up and try to walk any distance you’ll find your legs barely able to support you. [4] So if you like doing something, do it regularly; if you don’t like doing something, make a habit of doing something different. [5] The same goes for moral inclinations. When you get angry, you should know that you aren’t guilty of an isolated lapse, you’ve encouraged a trend and thrown fuel on the fire. [6] When you can’t resist sex with someone, don’t think of it as a temporary setback; you’ve fed your weakness and made it harder to uproot. [7] It is inevitable that continuous behaviour of any one kind is going to instil new habits and tendencies,


If you are seized by greed on some occasion, reason can be invoked to alert you to the danger.


Then the passion will abate and the mind will be restored to its former balance. [9] But if you don’t bring anything by way of relief, the mind will not return to normal; when it’s inflamed by an impression, it will yield to passion more quickly the next time. Keep it up, and the mind grows inured to vice; eventually the love of money is entrenched.


It will even do to socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past.


Don’t let the force of the impression when first it hits you knock you off your feet; just say to it, ‘Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test.’ Next, don’t let it pull you in by picturing to yourself the pleasures that await you. [25] Otherwise it will lead you by the nose wherever it wants. Oppose it with some good and honourable thought, and put the dirty one to rout. [26] Practise this regularly,


It’s a fight for autonomy, freedom, happiness and peace. [29] Remember God, ask him to be your helper and protector, as sailors pray to the Dioscuri for help in a storm.


‘Make a bad beginning and you’ll contend with troubles ever after.’


The body is the raw material of the doctor and physical therapist. Land is the farmer’s raw material. The raw material of the good man is his mind


as soon as you leave in the morning, subject whatever you see or hear to close study. Then formulate answers as if they were posing questions.


The soul is like a bowl of water, with the soul’s impressions like the rays of light that strike the water. [21] Now, if the water is disturbed, the light appears to be disturbed together with it – though of course it is not. [22] So when someone loses consciousness, it is not the person’s knowledge and virtues that are impaired, it is the breath that contains them. Once the breath returns to normal, knowledge and the virtues are restored to normal also.


Free is the person who lives as he wishes and cannot be coerced, impeded or compelled, whose impulses cannot be thwarted, who always gets what he desires and never has to experience what he would rather avoid. Now, who would want to go through life ignorant of how to achieve this? ‘No one.’ [2] Who wants to live with delusion and prejudice, being unjust, undisciplined, mean and ungrateful? ‘No one.’ [3] No bad person, then, lives the way he wants, and no bad man is free.


Diogenes says somewhere that one way to guarantee freedom is to be ready to die.


The man has to learn ‘what each specific thing means’, as Socrates often said, and stop casually applying preconceptions to individual cases. [42] This is the cause of everyone’s troubles, the inability to apply common preconceptions to particulars. Instead the opinions of men as to what is bad diverge. [43] One thinks that he is unwell, when it’s nothing of the kind; the problem is that he is not adapting preconceptions correctly. One imagines that he is poor, another that he has a difficult mother or father, still another that Caesar is not disposed in his favour. This is all caused by one and the same thing, namely, ignorance of how to apply one’s preconceptions.


nature has endowed you with resources to discover the truth. And if you can’t infer the answer yourself using only these resources, [52] listen to what those who have explored the question have to say:


his master is away; when he returns, the man’s true condition will be made plain to you. [59] ‘When who returns?’ Whoever has the means to give or take away any of the things he values.


‘Do we have that many masters?’


Well, what makes for freedom and fluency in the practice of writing? Knowledge of how to write. The same goes for the practice of playing an instrument. It follows that, in the conduct of life, there must be a science to living well.


Is it within your power to have your body perform perfectly whenever you want? ‘No.’ Or be in good health? ‘No.’ Or attractive? ‘Again, no.’ Well, then, the body isn’t yours, and is subject to everything physically stronger. ‘Granted.’ [67] What about land – can you have as much as you want, for as long as you want, in the condition you prefer? ‘No.’ And what about slaves? ‘No again.’ Clothing? ‘No.’ Your house? ‘No.’ Your horses? ‘No to all of the above.’ And if more than anything else you want your children to live, or your wife, your brother, or your friends, is this within your power to effect? ‘No, that isn’t either.’ [68] Is there nothing that is under your authority, that you have exclusive control over – does anything of the kind exist? ‘I don’t know.’ [69] Well, look at it this way. Can anyone make you assent to a false proposition? ‘No, no one can.’ So in the field of assent you cannot be hindered or obstructed. ‘Evidently.’ [70] And can anyone force you to choose something to which you’re opposed? ‘They can: when they threaten me with death or imprisonment, they compel my choice.’ But what if you despise death and imprisonment – are you still in that person’s thrall? ‘No.’ [71] Is your attitude towards death your affair, then? ‘It is.’ Therefore your will is your own business too. ‘I grant it.’


And can you be forced by anyone to desire something against your will? ‘No.’ Or to plan for, or project – or, in a word, regard outside impressions in any one way at all? [75] ‘No again. But when I’ve already conceived a wish for something, they can stop me from getting it.’ If you wish for something that is under your authority and cannot be obstructed, how will they stop you? ‘They can’t.’ And who says if you desire something outside your authority that you cannot be obstructed? [76] ‘Well, should I not desire health, then?’ No – nor, for that matter, anything else outside the limits of your authority; [77] and whatever you cannot produce or preserve at will lies outside your range. Don’t let your hands go near it, much less your desire. Otherwise you’ve consigned yourself to slavery and submitted your neck to the yoke, as you do whenever you prize something not yours to command, or grow attached to something like health that’s contingent on God’s will and variable, unstable, unpredictable and unreliable by nature. [78] ‘So my arm isn’t mine either?’ It’s a part of you, but by nature it is dirt, subject to restraint and main force, a slave to anything physically stronger. [79] And why single the arm out? For as long as its time lasts the whole body should be treated like a loaded donkey. If a donkey is requisitioned and seized by a soldier, let it go: don’t resist or complain, or you’ll be beaten, and lose the animal all the same. [80] And if this is how you should treat the body, what treatment should be reserved for the things that serve the body? If it’s a donkey, then they are the donkey’s bridle, pack saddle, shoes, barley and feed. Let them go too, give them up with even more speed and good grace than you did the animal. [81] When you’re thus practised and prepared to discriminate between what belongs to you and what doesn’t, what is subject to hindrance and what is not, and are ready to regard the latter as important to you and the former as irrelevant, then is there anyone, any more, you need be frightened of? ‘No.’


How is a fortress demolished? Not with weapons or fire – with judgements. We can capture the physical fortress, the one in the city, but our judgements about illness, or about attractive women, remain to be dislodged from the fortress inside us, together with the tyrants whom we host every day, though their identities change over time.


It was God brought you into the world, who showed you the light, gave you the people who support you, gave you reason and perception. And he brought you into the world as a mortal, to pass your time on earth with a little endowment of flesh, to witness his design and share for a short time in his feast and celebration. [105] So why not enjoy the feast and pageant while it’s given you to do so; then, when he ushers you out, go with thanks and reverence for what you were privileged for a time to see and hear.


‘Why did he bring me into the world on these conditions?’ If the conditions don’t suit you, leave. He doesn’t need a heckler in the audience. He wants people keen to participate in the dance and revels – people, that is, who would sooner applaud and favour the festival with their praise and acclamation. [109] As for those who are grumpy and dour, he won’t be sad to see them excluded. Even when they are invited, they don’t act as if they are on holiday, or play an appropriate part; instead they whine, they curse their fate, their luck and their company. They don’t appreciate what they have, including moral resources given to them for the opposite purpose – generosity of spirit, high-mindedness, courage and that very freedom we are now exploring.


‘Because I don’t consider the body to be my own, because I lack for nothing, and because the law is the only thing I esteem, nothing else.’ That’s what enabled him to be free.


A good actor preserves his reputation not by speaking lines out of turn but by knowing when to talk – and when to keep quiet.


Plato says, not just for death, but for torture, exile, flogging – and the loss of everything not belonging to you. [173] You will be a slave among slaves otherwise; even if you are a consul ten thousand times over, even if you make your residence on the Palatine, you will be a slave none the less.


For you will learn by experience that it’s true: the things that men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once they’re theirs.


For you will learn by experience that it’s true: the things that men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once they’re theirs. Meanwhile people to whom such things are still denied come to imagine that everything good will be theirs if only they could acquire them. Then they get them: and their longing is unchanged, their anxiety is unchanged, their disgust is no less, and they still long for whatever is lacking. [175] Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it. [176] Assure yourself of this by expending as much effort on these new ambitions as you did on those illusive goals: work day and night to attain a liberated frame of mind. [177] Instead of a rich old man, cultivate the company of a philosopher, be seen hanging around his door for a change.

You should be especially careful when associating with one of your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level; otherwise you will lose yourself.


It is a general rule that externals of any kind, if we attach importance to them, make us subject to somebody. [2] It makes no difference whether we wish to be a senator, or wish not to be one; whether we desire to have office, or to avoid it; whether we say, ‘I can’t do anything, unfortunately, I’m tied to my books like a stiff,’ or, ‘Sadly, I have no leisure for study.’ [3] A book is an external, just like office or public honours. [4] Why do you want to read anyway – for the sake of amusement or mere erudition? Those are poor, fatuous pretexts. Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn’t make you peaceful, what good is it?


What kind of peace is this that is so easily shattered – not by the emperor or even by a friend of the emperor, but by a crow, a street musician, a cold, or a thousand other annoyances? True peace is characterized by nothing so much as steadiness and imperturbability.


But life is composed of things other than books. It is as if an athlete, on entering the stadium, were to complain that he’s not outside exercising. [12] This was the goal of your exercise, of your weights, your practice ring and your training partners. You want them now that the time to exploit them has arrived? [13] Or it’s as if, in the matter of assent, when faced with impressions, instead of distinguishing which ones are convincing and which are not, we prefer to read a book entitled On Comprehensive Impressions.


you must laugh at someone who is anxious that he won’t hold office, then laugh at yourself as well.


Just keep in mind: the more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.


You should dissociate yourself from everything outside yourself – the body, possessions, reputation, books, applause, as well as office or lack of office. Because a preference for any of them immediately makes you a slave, a subordinate, and prone to disappointment. [34] Keep Cleanthes’ verse handy: Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny.


go to Rome. To Gyara? All right, I go to Gyara instead. To Athens? Then Athens it is. To jail? Well then I go to jail. [35] But if you ever think, ‘When do we get to go to Athens?’ you are already lost. Either you’re going to be depressed when your wish is not realized or foolishly pleased with yourself if it is, overjoyed for the wrong reasons.


Otherwise, look, you will always have to serve the person who is able to secure your release, or the person who can block your way. You will have to serve him the way you would an evil deity.


There is one road to peace and happiness (keep the thought nearby morning, noon and night): renunciation of externals; regarding nothing as your own; handing over everything to fortune and the deity. Leave those things in the care of the same people God appointed to govern them, [40] while you devote yourself to the one thing that is truly yours and that no one can obstruct; make that the focus of all your reading, your writing and your lecture attendance.


Never praise or blame people on common grounds; look to their judgements exclusively. Because that is the determining factor, which makes everyone’s actions either good or bad.
