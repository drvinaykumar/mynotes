I never, never could understand the process of motivation outside of practice, before practice. It is as if first I needed to be motivated and then I could get into action! Do you see? That is a very anti-dialectical way of understanding motivation. Motivation takes part in the action.


First learn the skills, and then you can get a real education! First get a real education and then you can get a good job! The best thing is always the thing you are not doing. No wonder students are non-cooperative.


The official pedagogy is motivating students against intellectual work. This power struggle in curriculum has led to a stalemate in schools and colleges, which various official bodies have mis-defined as student 'mediocrity.' I call it a 'performance strike' by students who refuse to study under current social conditions.


When students want something badly, they move heaven and earth to get it.


say that reading is not just to walk on the words, and it is not flying over the words either. Reading is re-writing what we are reading. Reading is to discover the connections between the text and the context of the text, and also how to connect the text/context with my context, the context of the reader. And what happens is that many times we read authors who died one hundred years ago and we know nothing about his or her time. And often we know very little about our own time!


The official curriculum asks them to submit to texts, lectures, and tests, to habituate them to submitting to authority. Students are very good at resisting the demands of authority, but they can also reject the nontraditional classroom. Some do it with silent disregard; some actively resist; some are simply out to lunch. The problem is to ease a transition gradually away from the old habits.
