One who has realized religion through his own being has a totally different understanding of it; the understanding of one who has been imitating others is not understanding at all. Truth cannot be imitated. You cannot become true by becoming a carbon copy. Truth is original, and to attain to it you have to be original too.


Seek the unknown, because through seeking the unknown you move out of the rut, out of the repetitive, mechanical way of life.


When knowledge exists not, there is love. Knowledge is against love. Knowledgeable people cannot love, and people who can love are never knowledgeable. Love makes you wise, but never knowledgeable. Knowledge makes you cunning and clever, but never loving.


peak experiences make a man healthy, and only a healthy man can have peak experiences.


Kabir says: don’t make religion a ritual. Ritual is a way of avoiding religion. Religion should be spontaneous, non-ritualistic. You should do it because you love doing it–not that it is a duty–and you should do it only spontaneously, when your heart feels like it. There is no need to go to the mosque or to the temple every day. There is no need to pray every day in the same way again and again–because if you repeat the same prayer every day you will not repeat it consciously, it will become mechanical.
