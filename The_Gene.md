The word code comes from the Latin caudex, the wooden pith of a tree on which scribes carved their writing.


Napoléon had asked Laplace why God was so conspicuously missing from his theory, Laplace had replied with epic cheekiness: “Sire, I had no need for that hypothesis”).


“How small a thought it takes to fill someone’s whole life,” the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote.


(thankfully, he had failed that exam—twice).


“Modesty is a virtue,” he would later write, “yet one gets further without it.”


Genetics, he called it: the study of heredity and variation—the word ultimately derived from the Greek genno, “to give birth.”


Erasmus Darwin, the polymath poet and doctor, who was also Charles Darwin’s grandfather.


“You have made a convert of an opponent in one sense, for I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”


Aristotle had recast heredity as the flow of information—a river of code moving from egg to the embryo. Centuries later, Mendel had stumbled on the essential structure of that information, the alphabet of the code. If Aristotle had described a current of information moving across generations, then Mendel had found its currency.


As with Dalton and the atom, neither Bateson nor Johannsen had any understanding of what a gene was. They could not fathom its material form, its physical or chemical structure, its location within the body or inside the cell, or even its mechanism of action. The word was created to mark a function; it was an abstraction.


Newton was a sickly, fragile child; John Calvin was severely asthmatic; Darwin suffered crippling bouts of diarrhea and near-catatonic depression. Herbert Spencer—the philosopher who had coined the phrase survival of the fittest—had spent much of his life bedridden with various illnesses, struggling with his own fitness for survival.


mean height of the sons of exceptionally tall fathers tended to be slightly lower than the father’s height—and closer to the population’s average—as if an invisible force were always dragging extreme features toward the center. This discovery—called regression to the mean—would have a powerful effect on the science of measurement and the concept of variance.


As the front of the American eugenics movement advanced from imprisonment to sterilization to outright murder, European eugenicists watched the escalation with a mix of eagerness and envy. By 1936, less than a decade after Buck v. Bell, a vastly more virulent form of “genetic cleansing” would engulf that continent like a violent contagion, morphing the language of genes and inheritance into its most potent and macabre form.


Over the next decades, a spray of Nobel Prizes would be showered on the occupants of the room: Morgan, his students, his student’s students, and even their students would all win the prize for their discoveries.


Hemophilia—like white eyes in fruit flies—is a sex-linked genetic illness. Females can be carriers and transmit the gene, but only males are afflicted by the disease. The mutation in the hemophilia gene, which affects the clotting of blood, had likely arisen spontaneously in Queen Victoria at birth.


failed his exams (like Darwin, like Mendel, and like Galton—the failure to achieve conventional milestones of success seems to be a running theme in this story).


So the final modification might be read as: genotype + environment + triggers + chance = phenotype Succinct, yet magisterial, this formula captured the essence of the interactions between heredity, chance, environment, variation, and evolution in determining the form and fate of an organism.


By the early 1920s, as women like Carrie Buck were being identified and carted off to eugenic camps in America, German eugenicists were expanding their own efforts to create a state-sponsored program to confine, sterilize, or eradicate “genetically defective” men and women.


First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak out for me.


Organisms exist not because of reactions that are possible, but because of reactions that are barely possible. Too much reactivity and we would spontaneously combust. Too little, and we would turn cold and die. Proteins enable these barely possible reactions, allowing us to live on the edges of chemical entropy—skating perilously, but never falling in.


Nearly every cellular function—metabolism, respiration, cell division, self-defense, waste disposal, secretion, signaling, growth, even cellular death—requires proteins. They are the workhorses of the biochemical world.


One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and the mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid. —James Watson


Science [would be] ruined if—like sports—it were to put competition above everything else. —Benoit Mandelbrot


Sugars provided energy. Fats stored it. Proteins enabled chemical reactions, speeding and controlling the pace of biochemical processes, thereby acting as the switchboards of the biological world.


Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in blood, for instance, performs one of the simplest and yet most vital reactions in physiology. When exposed to high levels of oxygen, hemoglobin binds oxygen. Relocated to a site with low oxygen levels, it willingly releases the bound oxygen. This property allows hemoglobin to shuttle oxygen from the lung to the heart and the brain.


The answer lies in the structure of the molecule. Hemoglobin A, the most intensively studied version of the molecule, is shaped like a four-leaf clover. Two of its “leaves” are formed by a protein called alpha-globin; the other two are created by a related protein, beta-globin.II Each of these leaves clasps, at its center, an iron-containing chemical named heme that can bind oxygen—a reaction distantly akin to a controlled form of rusting. Once all the oxygen molecules have been loaded onto heme, the four leaves of hemoglobin tighten around the oxygen like a saddle clasp. When unloading oxygen, the same saddle-clasp mechanism loosens. The unbinding of one molecule of oxygen coordinately relaxes all the other clasps, like the crucial pin-piece pulled out from a child’s puzzle. The four leaves of the clover now twist open, and hemoglobin yields its cargo of oxygen. The controlled binding and unbinding of iron and oxygen—the cyclical rusting and unrusting of blood—allows effective oxygen delivery into tissues. Hemoglobin allows blood to carry seventyfold more oxygen than what could be dissolved in liquid blood alone. The body plans of vertebrates depend on this property: if hemoglobin’s capacity to deliver oxygen to distant sites was disrupted, our bodies would be forced to be small and cold. We might wake up and find ourselves transformed into insects.


In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. Franklin was not included in the prize. She had died in 1958, at the age of thirty-seven, from diffusely metastatic ovarian cancer—an illness ultimately linked to mutations in genes.


a gene “acts” by encoding information to build a protein, and the protein actualizes the form or function of the organism.


a protein chain can twist and turn in space idiosyncratically, like a wire that has been sculpted into a unique shape. This shape-acquiring ability allows proteins to execute diverse functions in cells. They can exist as long, stretchable fibers in muscle (myosin). They can become globular in shape and enable chemical reactions—i.e., enzymes (DNA polymerase). They can bind colored chemicals and become pigments in the eye, or in a flower. Twisted into saddle clasps, they can act as transporters for other molecules (hemoglobin). They can specify how a nerve cell communicates with another nerve cell and thus become the arbiters of normal cognition and neural development.


The master copy of information—i.e., the gene—was stored permanently in a deep repository or vault. When a “translation request” was generated by a cell, a photocopy of the original was summoned from the vault of the nucleus. This facsimile of a gene (i.e., RNA) was used as a working source for translation into a protein. The process allowed multiple copies of a gene to be in circulation at the same time, and for the RNA copies to be increased or decreased on demand—facts that would soon prove to be crucial to the understanding of a gene’s activity and function.


From bacteria to elephants—from red-eyed flies to blue-blooded princes—biological information flowed through living systems in a systematic, archetypal manner: DNA provided instructions to build RNA. RNA provided instructions to build proteins. Proteins ultimately enabled structure and function—bringing genes to life. 


It was a Rube Goldberg disease. A change in the sequence of a gene caused the change in the sequence of a protein; that warped its shape; that shrank a cell; that clogged a vein; that jammed the flow; that racked the body (that genes built). Gene, protein, function, and fate were strung in a chain: one chemical alteration in one base pair in DNA was sufficient to “encode” a radical change in human fate.


Paris was declared an “open city”—spared from bombs and ruin, but fully accessible to Nazi troops.


As with flies, the bacterial mutants proved revealing. Monod and Jacob, working with Arthur Pardee, a microbial geneticist from America, discovered three cardinal principles that governed the regulation of genes. First, when a gene was turned on or off, the DNA master copy was always kept intact in a cell. The real action was in RNA: when a gene was turned on, it was induced to make more RNA messages and thereby produce more sugar-digesting enzymes. A cell’s metabolic identity—i.e., whether it was consuming lactose or glucose—could be ascertained not by the sequence of its genes, which was always constant, but by the amount of RNA that a gene was producing. During lactose metabolism, the RNAs for lactose-digesting enzymes were abundant. During glucose metabolism, those messages were repressed, and the RNAs for glucose-digesting enzymes became abundant.


A gene, in short, possessed not just information to encode a protein, but also information about when and where to make that protein. All that data was encrypted in DNA, typically appended to the front of every gene


Walter Noel’s red blood cells and liver cells contained the same genetic information—but gene regulation ensured that the hemoglobin protein was only present in red blood cells, and not in the liver. The caterpillar and the butterfly carry precisely the same genome—but gene regulation enables the metamorphosis of one into the other.


Embryogenesis could be reimagined as the gradual unfurling of gene regulation from a single-celled embryo. This was the “movement” that Aristotle had so vividly imagined centuries before.


into every genome, then, are the codes for proteins that will allow that genome to reproduce. This additional layer of complexity—that DNA encodes a protein that allows DNA to replicate—is important because it provides a critical node for regulation. DNA replication can be turned on and turned off by other signals and regulators, such as the age or the nutritional status of a cell, thus allowing cells to make DNA copies only when they are ready to divide. This scheme has a collateral rub: when the regulators themselves go rogue, nothing can stop a cell from replicating continuously. That, as we will soon learn, is the ultimate disease of malfunctioning genes—cancer.


Units of hereditary information, encoded in DNA and packaged on chromosomes, are transmitted through sperm and egg into an embryo, and from the embryo to every living cell in an organism’s body. These units encode messages to build proteins—and the messages and proteins, in turn, enable the form and function of a living organism.


The movement of genetic information from one chromosome to another occurs only under extremely special circumstances. The first occurs when sperm and eggs are generated for reproduction. Just before the spermiogenesis and oogenesis, the cell turns briefly into a playpen for genes. The paired maternal and paternal chromosomes hug each other and readily swap genetic information. The swapping of genetic information between paired chromosomes is crucial to the mixing and matching of hereditary information between parents. Morgan called this phenomenon crossing over (his students had used crossing over to map genes in flies). The more contemporary term is recombination—the ability to generate combinations of combinations of genes.


The second circumstance is more portentous. When DNA is damaged by a mutagen, such as X-rays, genetic information is obviously threatened. When such damage occurs, the gene can be recopied from the “twin” copy on the paired chromosome: part of the maternal copy may be redrafted from the paternal copy, again resulting in the creation of hybrid genes.


(“Excuse my big yawn,” he once told a student, “but I just came from my own lecture [on genetics].”)


We now know that about eight such chemicals—mostly proteins—are made by the fly during the development of the egg and deposited asymmetrically in the egg. These maternal factors are made and placed in the egg by the mother fly. The asymmetric deposition is only possible because the egg itself is placed asymmetrically in the mother fly’s body—thereby enabling her to deposit some of these maternal factors on the head end of the egg, and others on the tail end. The proteins create a gradient within the egg. Like sugar diffusing out of a cube in a cup of coffee, they are present at high concentration on one end of the egg, and low concentration on the other. The diffusion of a chemical through a matrix of protein can even create distinct, three-dimensional patterns—like a pool of syrup ribboning into oatmeal. Specific genes are activated at the high-concentration end versus at the low-concentration end, thereby allowing the head-tail axis to be defined, or other patterns to be formed.


Three features of the cellular map were striking. The first was its invariance.


Every cell knew what to “be” because genes told it what to “become” (and where and when to become).


In human cells, the activation of BCL2 results in a cell in which the death cascade is blocked, creating a cell that is pathologically unable to die: cancer.


But was the fate of every cell in the worm dictated by genes, and only genes? Horvitz and Sulston discovered occasional cells in the worm—rare pairs—that could choose one fate or another randomly, as if by coin flip. The fate of these cells was not determined by their genetic destiny, but by their proximity to other cells.

Notes: 1) the effect of satsang.even cells  are followimg it. 


The identity of an ambiguous cell was, in fact, regulated by signals from neighboring cells—but the neighboring cells were themselves genetically preprogrammed. The God of Worms had evidently left tiny loopholes of chance in the worm’s design, but He still wouldn’t throw dice. A worm was thus constructed from two kinds of inputs—“intrinsic” inputs from genes, and “extrinsic” inputs from cell-cell interactions.


In the proverbial story, the oracle at Delphi is asked to consider a boat on a river whose planks have begun to rot. As the wood decays, each plank is replaced, one by one—and after a decade, no plank is left from the original boat. Yet, the owner is convinced that it is the same boat. How can the boat be the same boat—the riddle runs—if every physical element of the original has been replaced? The answer is that the “boat” is not made of planks but of the relationship between planks.


humans and worms have about the same number of genes—around twenty thousand—and yet the fact that only one of these two organisms is capable of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel suggests that the number of genes is largely unimportant to the physiological complexity of the organism. “It is not what you have,” as a certain Brazilian samba instructor once told me, “it is what you do with it.”
