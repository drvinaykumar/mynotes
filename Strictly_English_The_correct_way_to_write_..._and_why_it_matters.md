The dictionary defines viable as “capable of living”, and therefore a term that should correctly be applied to beings, organisms and plants capable of life. However, it also cites a number of uses of the word since the 1950s in which it is used figuratively “of immaterial things and concepts”


We often read in newspapers that somebody has warned that something will happen. This is ungrammatical. The verb warn is transitive: it requires an object. Somebody has to be warned. If no such person or people is or are available (which is unlikely to be the case) then one has to write that somebody gave warning that such and such a thing would happen.


What is happening to the verb warn is a sign of the constant evolution of our language.


confusion is avoided when the pronoun is not too far removed from the noun or proper name to which it relates:


A sentence such as “he resented the fact that he had no power to refuse the summons, as his colleagues had”, is wrong. It is also ambiguous: do his colleagues have the power to refuse, or have they already refused? If the second clause began “such as his colleagues had” it would be correct: the such can refer only to power.


Elsewhere I lament and advise against the overuse of adjectives: they are a habit many writers need to bring under control.


The two main categories of verb are the transitive and the intransitive. A transitive verb is one where a subject does something to a direct object – “the dog ate the bone” or “the woman threw the ball”. An intransitive verb has no direct object: “he slept soundly” or “he dreamt he was there”.

Lowly means humble; if lowlily were being used to describe something that was low in any other sense (such as a voice, a ceiling or a mode of behaviour), then it would be an error.


The Fowlers specified five correct uses for the colon, and they hold good today. The first was between two antithetical clauses that could stand as sentences on their own, such as

The Fowlers specified five correct uses for the colon, and they hold good today. The first was between two antithetical clauses that could stand as sentences on their own, such as “sentence was passed: the prisoner broke down”. The second was for introducing a short quotation, as I have done frequently in this book. The third is when introducing a list, as in “those present were: Mr Smith, Mr Jones, Mr Brown, Mrs White”. The fourth is when something that becomes expected as a result of a first clause is delivered in a second, as in “the jury considered its verdict: it found Smith guilty”. The fifth is where the clause after the colon proves or explains the contents of the first, as in “always take care how you treat people on the way up: for you never know whom you might meet on the way down”.

No-one would hyphenate test match; but should one not, on the same principle, leave the hyphen out of cross-examination? I should say it is necessary. The word cross is susceptible of too many interpretations. A cross examination could be an exhibition of bad temper in examining somebody or something.


When which is used as a conjunction it should always be preceded by a comma, to emphasise that it is amplifying something about the contents of the clause that precedes it. So “I wore my green hat, which I bought in the sale”


When which is used as a conjunction it should always be preceded by a comma, to emphasise that it is amplifying something about the contents of the clause that precedes it. So “I wore my green hat, which I bought in the sale” has the correct punctuation. Were the comma removed the which should be replaced by a that. “I wore the green hat that I bought in the sale”


“none of us are free tonight”. The pronoun none is singular. It derives from the old English negation of one and means “not one”. Therefore one writes “none of us is free tonight”,
