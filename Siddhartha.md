they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he alone among hundreds of thousands. This is what I have thought and realized, when I have heard the teachings.

"You know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!"


down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.


This too, I have learned from the river: everything is coming back!


"I can think. I can wait. I can fast."


"Yesterday, I told you I knew how to think, to wait, and to fast, but you thought this was of no use.


Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons.

Too much knowledge had held him back, too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rules, to much self-castigation, so much doing and striving for that goal!


water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment!
