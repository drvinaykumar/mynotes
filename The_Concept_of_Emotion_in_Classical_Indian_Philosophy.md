The reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to rational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling. The fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to some views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According to these views, rational thought, which is representational and therefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from the feelings.

Indian philosophy, because of its soteriological nature with its emphasis on the attainment of liberation, is about freeing the mind from feelings and emotions because they constitute an attachment to the world. While this is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a justified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different positions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as is the case with regard to Western philosophy.

This article introduces some of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation to cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article roughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in classical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have paid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would classify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist account of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the other accounts. 1.

The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account of the emotions The discussion of this account will focus on the Nyāya-sūtras, Vātsyāyana's Nyāya-bhāṣya, Uddyotakara's Nyāya-vārttika and Jayanta Bhaṭṭa's Nyāya-mañjarī. In addition, the Vaiśeṣika-sūtras together with Śaṅkara Miśra's Vaiśeṣika-sūtra-upaskāra will be mentioned. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account of the emotions involves a strict division into cognition (jñāna) and mental phenomena that include a feeling aspect, such as love or attraction (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa). One of the main reasons for this is the acceptance of the existence of a permanent immaterial self (ātman) by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. According to their arguments, the ātman is a substance (dravya) which possesses several qualities (guṇas), such as cognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain. This enumeration shows that there is no common


According to their arguments, the ātman is a substance (dravya) which possesses several qualities (guṇas), such as cognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain.


The important aspect of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account is that the individual emotions, such as attachment and aversion are regarded as defects (doṣas) [NB 1.1.18] or impurities (upadhā) [VS and VSU 6.2.4]. These defects are the result of ignorance (mithyājñāna) and they give rise to actions that lead to the feeling of pleasure or pain.


The desire for eternal pleasure, however, is not detrimental to liberation; in fact it is a precondition for liberation.


cognition has a special status among the qualities of self: no other quality can be experienced without cognition.


The defects fall into 3 groups: i) attraction (rāga), ii) aversion (dveṣa) and iii) illusion (moha) [NS 4.1.3].


Even love, which is regarded as a positive emotion in many cultures, is ultimately a defect because all emotions lead to attachment and error.


For the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, pleasure and pain are not forms of cognition because they have different causes than cognitions [VS and VSU 10.1.5–6]. This means that we can have a cognition without a feeling and we can also have a feeling without a cognition.


The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika view shows similarities with the received view of the emotions in Western philosophy with regard to the point that feelings are a disturbance of cognition. However, in many Western accounts cognition is regarded as an end in itself because it coincides with the ideal of rational thinking, whereas according to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers cognition is not an end in itself. Rather, it is supposed to lead to the conclusion that final liberation is the ultimate aim and final liberation means the end of cognition.


By definition, any purely cognitive state of mind presupposes the existence of a mind or intellect. For Śaṃkara, however, the problem is that a mind will always have certain qualities that would be called emotive in Western philosophy, such as desire, aversion, hatred, pleasure or pain. So, as long there are cognitions, there will also be emotions. Therefore, both must be eliminated in order for the self to attain liberation. On this point, Śaṃkara agrees with the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. While Śaṃkara distinguishes between emotions and cognitions, his distinction is not as pronounced as that of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. He regards both as qualities of the mind or intellect.

Unlike the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Vedānta accounts of the emotions, the Sāṃkhya-Yoga account does not draw a fundamental distinction between feelings and cognitions. The reason for this is that the Sāṃkhya account rests on the division between puruṣa and prakṛti. The former is pure consciousness and does not contain any cognitions or feelings whereas prakṛti is primordial matter and has the three qualities (guṇas) sattva, rajas and tamas, which are aligned with different feelings: sattva with pleasure (sukha), rajas with pain (duḥkha) and tamas with confusion or illusion (moha).
