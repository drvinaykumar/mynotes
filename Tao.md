After all, the brain, the very organ of intelligence, defies linguistic description by even the greatest neurologists. It is thus that an ideographic language is a little closer to nature than one which is strictly linear and alphabetic.

“Superior virtue is not intentionally virtuous, and this is just why it is virtue,”


Standard average European (SAE) languages, for example, have sentences so structured that the verb (event) must be set in motion by the noun (thing)—thereby posing a metaphysical problem as tricky, and probably as meaningless, as that of the relation of mind to body. We cannot talk of “knowing” without assuming that there is some “who” or “what” that knows, not realizing that this is nothing more than a grammatical convention. The supposition that knowing requires a knower is based on a linguistic and not an existential rule, as becomes obvious when we consider that raining needs no rainer and clouding no clouder.


can we think of the heart as separate from the veins, or the branches from the tree? Just what exact delineations distinguish the bee process from the flower process? These distinctions are always somewhat arbitrary and conventional, even when described with very exact language, for the distinctions reside more in the language than in what it describes.


the whole enterprise of Western technology is “to make the world a better place”—to have pleasure without pain, wealth without

What is that which always retreats when pursued? Answer: yourself.


Thus the art of life is not seen as holding to yang and banishing yin, but as keeping the two in balance, because there cannot be one without the other.


Thirty spokes unite at the wheel’s hub; It is the center hole [literally, “from their not being”] that makes it useful. Shape clay into a vessel; It is the space within that makes it useful. Cut out doors and windows for a room; It is the holes which make it useful. Therefore profit comes from what is there; Usefulness from what is not there.


The capacity of mind is broad and huge, like the vast sky. Do not sit with a mind fixed on emptiness. If you do you will fall into a neutral kind of emptiness. Emptiness includes the sun, moon, stars, and planets, the great earth, mountains and rivers, all trees and grasses, bad men and good men, bad things and good things, heaven and hell; they are all in the midst of emptiness. The emptiness of human nature is also like this.7

Hridaya Sutra says, “That which is form is just that which is emptiness, and that which is emptiness is just that which is form.”


But when no risk is taken there is no freedom.


The five energies were identified, or better, symbolized, as (1) wood, which as fuel gives rise to (2) fire, which creates ash and gives rise to (3) earth, which in its mines contains (4) metal, which (as on the surface of a metal mirror) attracts dew and so gives rise to (5) water, and this in turn nourishes (1) wood.


(From) Tao arises One; from One arises Two; from Two arises Three; and from Three arise the ten thousand things.


Let your ears hear whatever they want to hear; let your eyes see whatever they want to see; let your mind think whatever it wants to think; let your lungs breathe in their own rhythm. Do not expect any special result, for in this wordless and idealess state, where can there be past or future, and where any notion of purpose? Stop, look, and listen … and stay there awhile before you go on reading.
