## Walden, Henry David Thoreau


I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Bramins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders "until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach"; or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars—even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor. They have no friend Iolaus to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra's head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.


One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living.


the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were.


Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?


One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.


We are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do;


there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one 


there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre.


Confucius said,


"To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge."


For the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of man's existence; as our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.


There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live.


Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?—for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their root, and often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in their flowering season.


there is greater anxiety,


commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience.


It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon.


Only they who go to soirées and


I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes.


It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people.


for our houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them; and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves.


It is a mistake to suppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich.


I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and threw them out the window in disgust.


We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agri-culture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb.


Men say they know many things; But lo! they have taken wings— The arts and sciences, And a thousand appliances; The wind that blows Is all that any body knows.


But a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes.


Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then, following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its extreme—a principle which should never be followed but with circumspection—to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay.


I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end.


If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practised but the art of life;—to


I doubt if Flying Childers ever carried a peck of corn to mill.


How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince.


It is best to avoid the beginnings of evil.


If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me—some of its virus mingled with my blood. No—in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way.


I never heard of a philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me, or the like of me.


"What's the news?" as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels.


When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations.


Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages.


## Influence, Robert B. Cialdini


because only healthy, normal turkey chicks make the peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single “cheep-cheep” noise. By reacting to just that one stimulus, the average mother turkey will nearly always behave correctly.


because only healthy, normal turkey chicks make the peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single “cheep-cheep” noise. By reacting to just that one stimulus, the average mother turkey will nearly always behave correctly. It takes a trickster like a scientist to make her tapelike response seem silly. The second important thing to understand is that we, too, have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually work to our advantage, the trigger features that activate them can be used to dupe us into playing them at the wrong times.3 This parallel form of human automatic action is aptly demonstrated in an experiment by Harvard social psychologist Ellen Langer. A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do. Langer demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I’m in a rush? The effectiveness of this request-plus-reason was nearly total: Ninety-four percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied. At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional information provided by the words “because I’m in a rush.” But a third type of request tried by Langer showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but the first one, “because,” that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer’s third type of request used the word “because” and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent)


The renowned British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead recognized this inescapable quality of modern life when he asserted that “civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”

Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy state, “The interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before.”


Automobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the price for a new car has been negotiated before suggesting one option after another that might be added. In the wake of a fifteen-thousand-dollar deal, the hundred or so dollars required for a nicety like an FM radio seems almost trivial in comparison.


us—the rule for reciprocation.1 The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.


Richard Leakey ascribes the essence of what makes us human to the reciprocity system: “We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation,”3


“There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.”6 Although the obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others.


reciprocity rule was implicated in my compliance with the request to buy the candy bars. The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action. We have already seen that one consequence of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along.


## Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman


Why be concerned with gossip? Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own.


The expectation of intelligent gossip is a powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home.


As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are.


improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them.


A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. Our story was no exception.


Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car in the next lane is dangerous.


When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly—but it is not an answer to the original question. The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.


a puzzling limitation of our mind: our excessive confidence in what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.


System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.


The often-used phrase “pay attention” is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail.


Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention.

learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.


The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.


pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy.


If you wish to experience your System 2 working at full tilt, the following exercise will do; it should bring you to the limits of your cognitive abilities within 5 seconds.


Studies of the brain have shown that the pattern of activity associated with an action changes as skill increases, with fewer brain regions involved. Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity. A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion.


people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.


System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. The automatic System 1 does not have these capabilities. System 1 detects simple relations (“they are all alike,” “the son is much taller than the father”) and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information.


One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. The

I must construct an intricate argument under time pressure, I would rather be still, and I would prefer sitting to standing.


For most of us, most of the time, the maintenance of a coherent train of thought and the occasional engagement in effortful thinking also require self-control.


People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.”


Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly very effortful. In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand.


In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand.


Several psychological studies have shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation.


System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth


Even in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline. An observer of the number of times I look at e-mail or investigate the refrigerator during an hour of writing could reasonably infer an urge to escape and conclude that keeping at it requires more self-control than I can readily muster.

Notes: 1) very important observation. 


self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.


people are first depleted by a task in which they eat virtuous foods such as radishes and celery while resisting the temptation to indulge in chocolate and rich cookies. Later, these people will give up earlier than normal when faced with a difficult cognitive task.


You are told that remembering the digits is your top priority. While your attention is focused on the digits, you are offered a choice between two desserts: a sinful chocolate cake and a virtuous fruit salad. The evidence suggests that you would be more likely to select the tempting chocolate cake when your mind is loaded with digits. System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth.


The list of situations and tasks that are now known to deplete self-control is long and varied. All involve conflict and the need to suppress a natural tendency. They include: avoiding the thought of white bears inhibiting the emotional response to a stirring film making a series of choices that involve conflict trying to impress others responding kindly to a partner’s bad behavior interacting with a person of a different race (for prejudiced individuals) The list of indications of depletion is also highly diverse: deviating from one’s diet overspending on impulsive purchases reacting aggressively to provocation persisting less time in a handgrip task performing poorly in cognitive tasks and logical decision making


self-control requires attention and effort.


When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who draws down glucose stored in her muscles during a sprint.

tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.

Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.


Overriding it requires hard work—the insistent idea that “it’s true, it’s true!” makes it difficult to check the logic, and most people do not take the trouble to think through the problem.


“Lazy” is a harsh judgment about the self-monitoring of these young people and their System 2, but it does not seem to be unfair. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.” They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions.

The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.


The events that took place as a result of your seeing the words happened by a process called associative activation: ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain.


In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1748, the Scottish philosopher David Hume reduced the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality.


The notion that we have limited access to the workings of our minds is difficult to accept because, naturally, it is alien to our experience, but it is true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do.


asked students at New York University—most aged eighteen to twenty-two—to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other.

being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel amused.


You can see why the common admonition to “act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.


A study of voting patterns in precincts of Arizona in 2000 showed that the support for propositions to increase the funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location.


Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils.


Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone.


“act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.


The evidence of priming studies suggests that reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death.


Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one’s body, an impulse that has been dubbed the “Lady Macbeth effect.” The cleansing is highly specific to the body parts involved in a sin. Participants in an experiment were induced to “lie” to an imaginary person, either on the phone or in e-mail. In a subsequent test of the desirability of various products, people who had lied on the phone preferred mouthwash over soap, and those who had lied in e-mail preferred soap to mouthwash.

Do these experiments demonstrate that we are completely at the mercy of whatever primes the environment provides at any moment? Of course not. The effects of the primes are robust but not necessarily large.

The experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT. Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out gray print. The puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain. The results tell a clear story: 90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made at least one mistake in the test, but the proportion dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible.

the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good. Obviously, this argument is not restricted to humans. To make that point, one of Zajonc’s associates exposed two sets of fertile chicken eggs to different tones. After they hatched, the chicks consistently emitted fewer distress calls when exposed to the tone they had heard while inhabiting the shell.

Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.


A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.

Michotte had a different idea: he argued that we see causality, just as directly as we see color. To make his point, he created episodes in which a black square drawn on paper is seen in motion; it comes into contact with another square, which immediately begins to move. The observers know that there is no real physical contact, but they nevertheless have a powerful “illusion of causality.” If the second object starts moving instantly, they describe it as having been “launched” by the first. Experiments have shown that six-month-old infants see the sequence of events as a cause-effect scenario, and they indicate surprise when the sequence is altered. We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation.


infants under one year old identify bullies and victims, and expect a pursuer to follow the most direct path in attempting to catch whatever it is chasing.


The psychologist Paul Bloom, writing in The Atlantic in 2005, presented the provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs. He observes that “we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, making it possible for us to envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls.”


“She can’t accept that she was just unlucky; she needs a causal story. She will end up thinking that someone intentionally sabotaged her work.”


Speaking of a woman he dislikes, he says, “Her favorite position is beside herself, and her favorite sport is jumping to conclusions.”

The moral is significant: when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.

a large number of observers are shown glass jars containing pennies and are challenged to estimate the number of pennies in each jar. As James Surowiecki explained in his best-selling The Wisdom of Crowds, this is the kind of task in which individuals do very poorly, but pools of individual judgments do remarkably well. Some individuals greatly overestimate the true number, others underestimate it, but when many judgments are averaged, the average tends to be quite accurate.

before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position.

When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions. Consider the following: “Will Mindik be a good leader? She is intelligent and strong…” An answer quickly came to your mind, and it was yes. You picked the best answer based on the very limited information available, but you jumped the gun.

From the same urn, two very patient marble counters take turns. Jack draws 4 marbles on each trial, Jill draws 7. They both record each time they observe a homogeneous sample—all white or all red. If they go on long enough, Jack will observe such extreme outcomes more often than Jill—by a factor of 8 (the expected percentages are 12.5% and 1.56%). Again,


Now imagine the population of the United States as marbles in a giant urn. Some marbles are marked KC, for kidney cancer. You draw samples of marbles and populate each county in turn.

There is a good chance that your first estimate of 2½ inches was shorter than the second.

Instead you should make a scene, storm out or threaten to do so, and make it clear—to yourself as well as to the other side—that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table.

## The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking, Oliver Burkeman


becoming familiar with failure, even learning to value death. In short, all these people seemed to agree that in order to be truly happy, we might actually need to be willing to experience more negative emotions – or, at the very least, to learn to stop running quite so hard from them. Which is a bewildering thought, and one that calls into question not just our methods for achieving happiness, but also our assumptions about what ‘happiness’ really means. These days, this notion certainly gets less press than the admonition to remain positive at all times. But it is a viewpoint with a surprisingly long and respectable history. You’ll


You’ll find it in the works of the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome, who emphasised the benefits of always contemplating how badly things might go. It lies deep near the core of Buddhism, which counsels that true security lies in the unrestrained embrace of insecurity – in the recognition that we never really stand on solid ground, and never can. It underpins the medieval tradition of memento mori, which celebrated the life-giving benefits of never forgetting about death.


some psychologists have reached the conclusion that pessimism may often be as healthy and productive as optimism.

‘Metacognition’, Wegner explains, ‘occurs when thought takes itself as an object.’ Mainly, it’s an extremely useful skill: it is what enables us to recognise when we are being unreasonable, or sliding into depression, or being afflicted by anxiety, and then to do something about it. But when we use metacognitive thoughts directly to try to control our other, everyday, ‘objectlevel’ thoughts – by suppressing images of white bears, say, or replacing gloomy thoughts with happy ones – we run into trouble.


Wegner’s studies suggest, if you are tired, stressed, depressed, attempting to multi-task, or otherwise suffering from ‘mental load’ – metacognition will frequently go wrong. The monitoring process will start to occupy more than its fair share of limelight on the cognitive stage. It will jump to the forefront of consciousness – and suddenly, all you will be able to think about is white bears, and how badly you’re doing at not thinking about them.


when experimental subjects are told of an unhappy event, but then instructed to try not to feel sad about it, they end up feeling worse than people who are informed of the event, but given no instructions about how to feel. In another study, when patients who were suffering from panic disorders listened to relaxation tapes, their hearts beat faster than patients who listened to audiobooks with no explicitly ‘relaxing’ content. Bereaved people who make the most effort to avoid feeling grief, research suggests, take the longest to recover from their loss. Our efforts at mental suppression fail in the sexual arena, too: people instructed not to think about sex exhibit greater arousal, as measured by the electrical conductivity of their skin, than those not instructed to suppress such thoughts.


Wood’s hunch was that people who seek out affirmations would be, by definition, those with low self-esteem – but that, for that very same reason, they would end up reacting against the messages in the affirmations, because they conflicted with their self-images. Messages such as ‘Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better’ would clash with their poor opinion of themselves, and thus be rejected, so as not to threaten the coherence of their sense of self. The result might even be a worsening of their low self-esteem, as people struggled to reassert their existing self-images against the incoming messages.


‘There are lots of ways of being miserable,’ says a character in a short story by Edith Wharton, ‘but there’s only one way of being comfortable, and that is to stop running around after happiness.’

In experiment after experiment, people responded to positive visualisation by relaxing. They seemed, subconsciously, to have confused visualising success with having already achieved it.


When Zeno began to teach philosophy himself, he did so under the stoa poikile, the ‘painted porch’ on the north side of the ancient agora of Athens – hence the label ‘Stoic’. The


Nature had bestowed uniquely upon humans, the Stoics argued, the capacity to reason, and therefore a ‘virtuous’ life – meaning a life proper and fitting to a human – entailed living in accordance with reason.


And here lies the essential difference between Stoicism and the modern-day ‘cult of optimism’. For the Stoics, the ideal state of mind was tranquility, not the excitable cheer that positive thinkers usually seem to mean when they use the word ‘happiness’. And tranquility was to be achieved not by strenuously chasing after enjoyable experiences, but by cultivating a kind of calm indifference towards one’s circumstances. One way to do this, the Stoics argued, was by turning towards negative emotions and experiences; not shunning them, but examining them closely instead.


Most of us, the Stoics point out, go through life under the delusion that it is certain people, situations, or events that make us sad, anxious, or angry. When you’re irritated by a colleague at the next desk who won’t stop talking, you naturally assume that the colleague is the source of the irritation; when you hear that a beloved relative is ill and feel pained for them, it makes sense to think of the illness as the source of the pain. Look closely at your experience, though, say the Stoics, and you will eventually be forced to conclude that neither of these external events is ‘negative’ in itself. Indeed, nothing outside your own mind can properly be described as negative or positive at all. What actually causes suffering are the beliefs you hold about those things.


‘Things do not touch the soul,’ is how Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher–emperor, expresses the notion, adding: ‘Our perturbations come only from the opinion which is within.’


Stoic would point out, it just isn’t a particularly good technique for feeling happier. Ceaseless optimism about the future only makes for a greater shock when things go wrong; by fighting to maintain only positive beliefs about the future, the positive thinker ends up being less prepared, and more acutely distressed, when things eventually happen that he can’t persuade himself to believe are good. (And such things will happen.)


‘Whenever you grow attached to something,’ writes Epictetus, ‘do not act as though it were one of those things that cannot be taken away, but as though it were something like a jar or a crystal goblet … if you kiss your child, your brother, your friend remind yourself that you love a mortal, something not your own; it has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig, or a bunch of grapes, at a fixed season of the year.’ Each time you kiss your child goodnight, he contends, you should specifically consider the possibility that she might die tomorrow. This is jarring advice that might strike any parent as horrifying, but Epictetus is adamant: the practice will make you love her all the more, while simultaneously reducing the shock should that awful eventuality ever come to pass.


if you offer reassurance to a friend who is in the grip of anxiety, you’ll often find that a few days later, he’ll be back for more. Worse, reassurance can actually exacerbate anxiety: when you reassure your friend that the worstcase scenario he fears probably won’t occur, you inadvertently reinforce his belief that it would be catastrophic if it did. You are tightening the coil of his anxiety, not loosening it. All too often, the Stoics point

Worse, reassurance can actually exacerbate anxiety: when you reassure your friend that the worstcase scenario he fears probably won’t occur, you inadvertently reinforce his belief that it would be catastrophic if it did. You are tightening the coil of his anxiety, not loosening it. All too often, the Stoics point out, things will not turn out for the best.


Happiness reached via positive thinking can be fleeting and brittle; negative visualisation generates a vastly more dependable calm.


As Seneca frequently observes, we habitually act as if our control over the world were much greater than it really is.


‘Never have I trusted Fortune,’ writes Seneca, ‘even when she seemed to be at peace. All her generous bounties – money, office, influence – I deposited where she


‘Never have I trusted Fortune,’ writes Seneca, ‘even when she seemed to be at peace. All her generous bounties – money, office, influence – I deposited where she could ask for them back without disturbing me.’


The only things we can truly control, the Stoics argue, are our judgments – what we believe – about our circumstances. But this isn’t bad news.


‘The cucumber is bitter? Put it down,’ Marcus advises. ‘There are brambles in the path? Step to one side. That is enough, without also asking: “How did these things come into the world at all?”’


‘As the Buddha said two-and-a-half thousand years ago,’ he said, soon after we’d started talking, and jabbing a finger in my direction, ‘we’re all out of our fucking minds! That’s just the way we are.’


Explaining the difference between a terrible outcome and a merely undesirable one became a governing mission of Ellis’s career. He went so far as to insist that nothing at all could ever be absolutely terrible – ‘because’, he wrote, ‘when you insist that an undesirable event is awful or terrible, you are implying, if you’re honest with yourself, that it is as bad as it could be.’ Yet nothing could be 100 per cent bad, he argued, because it could always conceivably be worse. Even if one were murdered, ‘that is very bad, but not one hundred per cent bad,’ because several of your loved ones could meet the same fate, ‘and that would be worse. If you are tortured to death slowly, you could always be tortured to death slower.’


You want it to be one way. But it’s the other way. – Marlo Stanfield in The Wire


At the root of all suffering, says the second of the four ‘noble truths’ that define Buddhism, is attachment. The fact that we desire some things, and dislike or hate others, is what motivates virtually every human activity.


Develop a strong attachment to your good looks – as opposed to merely enjoying them while they last – and you will suffer when they fade, as they inevitably will; develop a strong attachment to your luxurious lifestyle, and your life may become an unhappy, fearful struggle to keep things that way. Attach too strongly to life, and death will seem all the more frightening.


Non-attachment need not mean withdrawing from life, or suppressing natural impulses, or engaging in punishing self-denial. It simply means approaching the whole of life – inner thoughts and emotions, outer events and circumstances – without clinging or aversion.


Magid objected to the notion that meditation had a point. If it did, he seemed to imply, that would make it just another happiness technique, a way of satisfying our desire to cling to certain states and eliminate others.


struggling to escape your demons was what gave them their power.


‘The quintessential point,’ he told me, ‘is that if you flee it, it’ll come back to bite you. The very thing from which you’re in flight – well, it’s the fleeing that brings on the problem.


‘One realises’, as the spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti once put it, ‘that one’s brain is constantly chattering, constantly planning, designing: what it will do, what it has done, the past impinging itself on the present. It is everlasting chattering, chattering, chattering.’


In this the Buddhists go further than the Stoics, who can sometimes seem rather attached to certain mind-states, especially that of tranquility. The perfect Stoic adapts his or her thinking so as to remain undisturbed by undesirable circumstances; the perfect Buddhist sees thinking itself as just another set of circumstances, to be non-judgmentally observed.


people who really do get a lot done – very rarely include techniques for ‘getting motivated’ or ‘feeling inspired’. Quite the opposite: they tend to emphasise the mechanics of the working process, focusing not on generating the right mood, but on accomplishing certain physical actions, regardless of mood.


‘Inspiration is for amateurs,’ the artist Chuck Close once memorably observed. ‘The rest of us just show up and get to work.’


‘People … think that they should always like what they do, and that their lives should be trouble-free,’ Maria wrote. ‘Consequently, their mental energy is wasted by their impossible attempts to avoid feelings of displeasure or boredom.’


‘Sometimes clouds come and cover it, but the moon is always behind them. Clouds go away, then the moon shines brightly. So don’t worry about clear mind; it is always there. When thinking comes, behind it is clear mind. When thinking goes, there is only clear mind. Thinking comes and goes, comes and goes. You must not be attached to the coming and going.’


Kayes suspected, had been ‘lured into destruction by their passion for goals’.


‘You can overpursue goals,’ he reflected afterwards. ‘You can become obsessed with goals.’


Ordóñez and her colleagues mounted the case for the opposition in a 2009 paper with a heavy-handed pun for its title – ‘Goals Gone Wild’ – in the usually rather dry pages of the journal Academy of Management Perspectives. The goalsetting that worked so well in Latham and Locke’s studies, they pointed out, had various nasty side-effects in their own experiments. For example: clearly defined goals seemed to motivate people to cheat. In one such study, participants were given the task of making words from a set of random letters, as in Scrabble; the experiment gave them opportunities to report their progress anonymously. Those given a target to reach lied far more frequently than did those instructed merely to ‘do your best’.


‘When we try to pick out any thing by itself,’ the naturalist and philosopher John Muir observed, ‘we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.’


‘The continued existence of complex interactive systems’, Bateson argued, ‘depends upon preventing the maximisation of any variable.’ This need not be taken as an argument for abandoning all future planning whatsoever, but it serves as a warning not to strive too ardently for any single vision of the future.


Chris Kayes pointed out, the mountaineers who died climbing Everest in 1996 did successfully reach their goal: they ascended to the summit. The tragic unintended consequence was that they didn’t make it back down alive.


‘I always live by the motto of “ready, fire, aim”,’ said one. ‘I think that if you spend too much time doing “ready, aim, aim, aim”,


The most valuable skill of a successful entrepreneur, Chris Kayes is convinced, isn’t ‘vision’ or ‘passion’ or a steadfast insistence on destroying every barrier between yourself and some prize you’re obsessed with. Rather, it’s the ability to adopt an unconventional approach to learning: an improvisational flexibility not merely about which route to take towards some predetermined objective, but also a willingness to change the destination itself.


One foundation of effectuation is the ‘bird in hand’ principle: ‘Start with your means. Don’t wait for the perfect opportunity. Start taking action, based on what you have readily available: what you are, what you know and who you know.’ A second is the ‘principle of affordable loss’: don’t be guided by thoughts of how wonderful the rewards might be if you were spectacularly successful at any given next step. Instead – and there are distinct echoes, here, of the Stoic focus on the worst-case scenario – ask how big the loss would be if you failed. So long as it would be tolerable, that’s all you need to know. Take that next step, and see what happens.

French philosopher René Descartes’s dictum Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I am.


As the German scientist Georg Lichtenberg would later phrase it, Descartes was entitled only to claim that ‘thinking is occurring’, not ‘I think, therefore I am.’ It was the great Scottish philosopher David Hume, writing in the first half of the eighteenth century, who most vividly illustrated this hidden assumption, proposing a thought experiment of his own. Never mind systematic doubt, Hume suggested: instead, simply try turning your attention inwards, and trying to find this thing you call your self.


Hume was stumped: For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov’d for any time, as by sound sleep, so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist … If any one upon serious and unprejudic’d reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I can reason no longer with him.


Stoics, who concluded that our judgments about the world are the source of our distress.


When Descartes said ‘I think, therefore I am,’ he had not discovered ‘the most fundamental truth’, Tolle insists; instead, he had given expression to ‘the most basic error’.


what do you take to be the boundary of yourself


Watts has a ready response to that. Do you really exert conscious control, he wonders, over your breathing? Do you actively and consciously pump the blood through your veins, or dispatch antibodies to fight viral infections? You don’t: those things just happen.


that no matter where you draw the boundary – even if we could agree on a place at which to draw it – you would not really be drawing a boundary, in the conventional sense, at all. Because (here it comes) the very notion of a boundary line depends on it having two sides. When you think about it, it doesn’t make much sense to describe a boundary as something that keeps two things apart. It makes more sense to describe it as the place at which they meet – or, more accurately, the place at which they are exactly the same thing. The inside of the boundary relies for its very existence on the outside, and vice versa; they are, inextricably and by definition, part of the same whole. You simply can’t have the peak of a wave without the trough, or darkness without light.

Notes: 1) What do you think is yoir boundary. 


‘Really,’ Watts wrote, ‘the fundamental, ultimate mystery – the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets – is this: that for every outside, there is an inside, and that for every inside, there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together.’


that people who find themselves in what the rest of us might consider conditions of extreme insecurity – such as severe poverty – discover insights into happiness from which the rest of us could stand to learn. And if the most radical proponents of the ‘negative path’ are to be believed, in turning towards insecurity we may come to understand that security itself is a kind of illusion – and that we were mistaken, all along, about what it was we thought we were searching for.


we habitually fear threats from other humans more than threats from the natural world. We fear threats that we can easily call vividly to mind more than those we find difficult to picture – the so-called ‘availability bias’.

To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung, and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no-one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with your hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket – safe, dark, motionless, airless – it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.


Thomas Merton expressed in his autobiography The Seven Storey Mountain. ‘The truth that many people never understand’, he wrote, ‘is that the more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you, in proportion to your fear of being hurt.’ Seen this way, it becomes clear that security-chasing is a large part of the problem with the ‘cult of optimism’. Through positive thinking and related approaches, we seek the safety and solid ground of certainty, of knowing how the future will turn out, of a time in the future when we’ll be ceaselessly happy, and never have to fear negative emotions again. But in chasing all that, we close down the very faculties that permit the happiness we crave.


her point is that when things fall apart, however painful the experience, it’s a good thing; the collapse of your apparent security represents a confrontation with life as it really is. ‘Things are not permanent, they don’t last, there is no final security,’ she says. What makes us miserable is not this truth, but our efforts to escape it.


but when you don’t have access to the good clothes and the nice jobs, when you don’t have any of that to hold onto, you have to let people know you through your way of being, not through what you’re wearing, or your job title. You actually have to be kind to people if you want them to like you! You have to look into their eyes! We don’t have that so much in the US, because it’s, like, ‘look what I’m wearing; look what it says on my business card – I don’t need to be nice to you’.


‘The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing,’ concludes Watts. ‘To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest, in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet.’


Watts writes: To understand that there is no security is far more than to agree with the theory that all things change, more even than to observe the transitoriness of life. The notion of security is based on the feeling that there is something within us which is permanent, something which endures through all the days and changes of life. We are struggling to make sure of the permanence, continuity, and safety of this enduring core, this centre and soul of our being, which we call ‘I’. For this we know to be the real man – the thinker of our thoughts; the feeler of our feelings, the knower of our knowledge. We do not actually understand that there is no security until we realise that this ‘I’ does not exist.

the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or DLPFC. This region plays a crucial role in filtering out irrelevant or unwanted incoming information, which is essential if you want to concentrate, say, on a single conversation at a noisy cocktail party. (People with damaged DLPFCs experience difficulty with such tasks.) But a similar filtering process appears to be triggered when we are presented with information that violates our expectations, even when it is far from irrelevant.


It may well be true that successful entrepreneurs possess perseverance and leadership skills, of course. What is less obvious – and much less boring – is what the speaker neglected to mention: that those traits are likely to be the characteristics of extremely unsuccessful people, too. ‘Think about it,’ Denrell observed afterwards. ‘Incurring large losses requires both persistence … and the ability to persuade others to pour their money down the drain.’ People without much perseverance or charisma are more likely to end up in the middle, experiencing neither great success nor great failure. (If you never stick at anything, and if you can’t persuade others to follow you, you may never lead an army of like-minded souls to a stunning victory – but nor will you lead them off a cliff.)

‘Downfall’, writes the American Zen Buddhist Natalie Goldberg, ‘brings us to the ground, facing the nitty-gritty, things as they are with no glitter. Success cannot last forever. Everyone’s time runs out.’ She goes on: ‘Achievement solidifies us. Believing we are invincible, we want more and more.’ To see and feel things as they really are, ‘we have to crash. Only then can we drop through to a more authentic self. Zen transmits its legacy from this deeper place. It is a different kind of failure: the Great Failure, a boundless surrender. Nothing to hold on to, and nothing to lose.’


The classic example of a person with a ‘fixed theory’ is the young sports star who is encouraged to think of himself as a ‘natural’ – but who then fails to put in sufficient practice to realise his potential. If talent is innate, his unspoken reasoning goes, then why bother?


Should you wish to encourage an incremental outlook rather than a fixed one in your children, Dweck advises, take care to praise them for their effort rather than for their intelligence.


‘One of the main reasons that it is so easy to march men off to war’, Becker observes, bleakly, ‘is that deep down, each of them feels sorry for the man next to him who will die. Each protects himself in this fantasy until the shock that he is bleeding.’

## Stumbling on Happiness, Daniel Gilbert

that damage to certain parts of the frontal lobe can make people feel calm but that it can also leave them unable to plan


As scientists now recognize, the frontal lobe ‘empowers healthy human adults with the capacity to consider the self’s extended existence throughout time’.


This frontal lobe–the last part of the human brain to evolve, the slowest to mature and the first to deteriorate in old age–is a time machine that allows each of us to vacate the present and experience the future before it happens. No other animal has a frontal lobe quite like ours, which is why we are the only animal that thinks about the future as we do. But if the story of the frontal lobe tells us bow people conjure their imaginary tomorrows, it doesn’t tell us why.


When researchers actually count the items that float along in the average person’s stream of consciousness, they find that about 12 per cent of our daily thoughts are about the future.


Indeed, some events are more pleasurable to imagine than to experience (most of us can recall an instance in which we made love with a desirable partner or ate a wickedly rich dessert, only to find that the act was better contemplated than consummated), and in these cases people may decide to delay the event forever.


Knowledge is power, and the most important reason why our brains insist on simulating the future even when we’d rather be here now, enjoying a goldfish moment, is that our brains want to control the experiences we are about to have.


We have a large frontal lobe so that we can look into the future, we look into the future so that we can make predictions about it, we make predictions about it so that we can control it–but why do we want to control it at all? Why not just let the future unfold as it will and experience it as it does? Why not be here now and there then? There are two answers to this question, one of which is surprisingly right and the other of which is surprisingly wrong. The surprisingly right answer is that people find it gratifying to exercise control–not just for the futures it buys them, but for the exercise itself. Being


research suggests that if they lose their ability to control things at any point between their entrance and their exit, they become unhappy, helpless, hopeless and depressed.40 And occasionally dead.


Our desire to control is so powerful, and the feeling of being in control so rewarding, that people often act as though they can control the uncontrollable.


In fact, the one group of people who seem generally immune to this illusion are the clinically depressed,48 who tend to estimate accurately the degree to which they can control events in most situations.49 These and other findings have led some researchers to conclude that the feeling of control–whether real or illusory–is one of the wellsprings of mental health.50 So


We insist on steering our boats because we think we have a pretty good idea of where we should go, but the truth is that much of our steering is in vain–not because the boat won’t respond, and not because we can’t find our destination, but because the future is fundamentally different than it appears through the prospectiscope.


Emotional happiness is the most basic of the trio–so


Philosophers like to say that subjective states are ‘irreducible’, which is to say that nothing we point to, nothing we can compare them with, and nothing we can say about their neurological underpinnings can fully substitute for the experiences themselves.5


‘Who thus define it, say they more or less / Than this, that happiness is happiness?’


If there has ever been a group of human beings who prefer despair to delight, frustration to satisfaction and pain to pleasure, they must be very good at hiding because no one has ever seen them. People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically meant to be means to that end.


Blaise Pascal was especially clear on this point: All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.


John Stuart Mill wrote, ‘It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.’14


Happiness is a word that we generally use to indicate an experience and not the actions that give rise to it.


‘The computer obeyed all Ten Commandments and was happy as a clam’?


Happiness refers to feelings, virtue refers to actions, and those actions can cause those feelings. But not necessarily and not exclusively.


For example, when a person says, ‘All in all, I’m happy about the way my life has gone’, psychologists are generally willing to grant that the person is happy. The problem is that people sometimes use the word happy to express their beliefs about the merits of things, such as when they say, ‘I’m happy they caught the little bastard who broke my windshield’, and they say things like this even when they are not feeling anything vaguely resembling pleasure.


That’s fine, just as long as we keep in mind that we don’t always mean what we say.


Every act of memory would require precisely the amount of time that the event being remembered had originally taken, which would permanently sideline us the first time someone asked if we liked growing up in Chicago. So we reduce our experiences to words such as happy, which barely do them justice but which are the things we can carry reliably and conveniently with us into the future.


The point of these studies is not that we are hopelessly inept at detecting changes in our experience of the world but rather that unless our minds are keenly focused on a particular aspect of that experience at the very moment it changes, we will be forced to rely on our memories–forced to compare our current experience to our recollection of our former experience–in order to detect the change.


It does not mean that those who don’t know what they’re missing are less happy than those who have it. Examples abound in my life and yours, so let’s talk about mine. I occasionally smoke a cigar because it makes me happy, and my wife occasionally fails to understand why I must have a cigar to be happy when she can apparently be just as happy without one (and even happier without me having one).


children who say they are delighted by peanut butter and jelly are just plain wrong, and they will admit it later in life when they get their first bite of goose liver, at which time they will be right, until they get older and begin to get heartburn from fatty foods, at which time they will realize that they were wrong then too. Every day would be a repudiation of the day before, as we experienced greater and greater happiness and realized how thoroughly deluded we were until, conveniently enough, now. So which hypothesis is correct? We can’t say. What we can say is that all claims of happiness are claims from someone’s point of view–from the perspective of a single human being whose unique collection of past experiences serves as a context, a lens, a background for her evaluation of her current experience.


‘Hi, you’re fine, how am I?’ I know, I know. The joke isn’t that funny. But the reason it’s supposed to be funny is that people shouldn’t know how others are feeling but they should know how they’re feeling themselves. ‘How are you?’ is overly familiar for the same reason that ‘How am I?’ is overly strange. And yet, strange as it is, there are times when people seem not to know their own hearts.


actions such as running away are so vitally important to the survival of terrestrial mammals like the ones from whom we are descended that evolution took no chances and designed the brain to answer the ‘What should I do?’ question before the ‘What is it?’ question.


It is possible to mistake fear for lust, apprehension for guilt,7 shame for anxiety.


The word experience comes from the Latin experientia, meaning ‘to try’, whereas the word aware comes from the Greek horan, meaning ‘to see’. Experience implies participation in an event, whereas awareness implies observation of an event.


alexithymia, which literally means ‘absence of words to describe emotional states’.


Once upon a time there was a bearded God who made a small, flat earth, and pasted it in the very middle of the sky so that human beings would be at the centre of everything. Then physics came along and complicated the picture with big bangs, quarks, branes and superstrings, and the payoff for all that critical analysis is that now, several hundred years later, most people have no idea where they are.


But it is not science because science is about measurement, and if a thing cannot be measured–cannot be compared with a clock or a ruler or something other than itself–it is not a potential object of scientific enquiry.

Notes: 1) Psychology 


if we adhere to the standard of perfection in all our endeavours, we are left with nothing but mathematics and the White Album. So maybe we just need to accept a bit of fuzziness and stop complaining.


If we have a deep scratch on our eyeglasses and don’t know it, we may erroneously conclude that a small crack has opened in the fabric of space and is following us wherever we go.


Quantum physics offers a similar lesson. We know that subatomic particles have the strange and charming ability to exist in two places at once, and if we assume that anything composed of these particles must behave likewise, we should expect all cows to be in all possible barns at the same time. Which they obviously are not, because fixedness is another one of those properties that emerges from the interaction of a terribly large number of terribly tiny parts that do not themselves have it. In short, more is not just more–it is sometimes other–than less.


The bottom line is this: the attentive person’s honest, real-time report is an imperfect approximation of her subjective experience, but it is the only game in town. When a fruit salad, a lover or a jazz trio is just too imperfect for our tastes, we stop eating, kissing and listening. But the law of large numbers suggests that when a measurement is too imperfect for our tastes, we should not stop measuring. Quite the opposite–we should measure again and again until niggling imperfections yield to the onslaught of data.


War, peace, art, money, marriage, birth, death, disease, religion–these are just a few of the Really Big Topics over which oceans of blood and ink have been spilled, but they are really big topics for one reason alone: each is a powerful source of human emotion. If they didn’t make us feel uplifted, desperate, thankful and hopeless, we would keep all that ink and blood to ourselves. As Plato asked, ‘Are these things good for any other reason except that they end in pleasure, and get rid of and avert pain? Are you looking to any other standard but pleasure and pain when you call them good?’19 Indeed, feelings don’t just matter–they are what mattering means.


We know that happiness is to be found on the golf course and not on the assembly line, with Lana but not with Lisa, as a potter but not as a plumber, in Atlanta but not in Afghanistan, and we know these things because we can look forward in time and simulate worlds that do not yet exist.


Imagination is a powerful tool that allows us to conjure images from ‘airy nothing’. But like all tools, this one has its shortcomings, and in this and the next chapter I’ll tell you about the first of them. The best way to understand this particular shortcoming of imagination (the faculty that allows us to see the future) is to understand the shortcomings of memory (the faculty that allows us to see the past) and perception (the faculty that allows us to see the present).


our brains take millions of snapshots, record millions of sounds, add smells, tastes, textures, a third spatial dimension, a temporal sequence, a continuous running commentary–and they do this all day, every day, year after year, storing these representations of the world in a memory bank that seems never to overflow and yet allows us to recall at a moment’s notice that awful day in the sixth grade when we teased Phil Meyers about his braces and he promised to beat us up after school. How do we cram the vast universe of our experience into the relatively small storage compartment between our ears? We do what Harpo did: we cheat.


the act of remembering involves ‘filling in’ details that were not actually stored; and second, we generally cannot tell when we are doing this because filling in happens quickly and unconsciously.7 Indeed, this phenomenon is so


The powerful and undetectable filling in that suffuses our remembrances of things past pervades our perceptions of things present as well. For instance, if on one particularly slow Tuesday you took it upon yourself to dissect your eyeball, you would eventually come across a spot on the back of your retina where your optic nerve leaves your eye and wends its way toward your brain. The eyeball cannot register an image at the point at which the optic nerve attaches, and hence that point is known as the blind spot. No one can see an object that appears in the blind spot because there are no visual receptors there. And yet, if you look out into your living room, you do not notice a black hole in the otherwise smooth picture of your brother-in-law sitting on the sofa, devouring cheese dip. Why? Because your brain uses information from the areas around the blind spot to make a reasonable guess about what the blind spot would see if only it weren’t blind, and then your brain fills in the scene with this information. That’s right, it invents things, creates things, makes stuff up!


act. Fig. 8. If you stare at the magician with your right eye and move the book slowly toward your nose, the earth will disappear into your blind spot.


In an even more remarkable study, volunteers listened to a recording of the word eel preceded by a cough (which I’ll denote with a *). The volunteers heard the word peel when it was embedded in the sentence ‘The *eel was on the orange’ but they heard the word heel when it was embedded in the sentence ‘The *eel was on the shoe.’13 This is a striking finding because the two sentences differ only in their final word, which means that volunteers’ brains had to wait for the last word of the sentence before they could supply the information that was missing from the second word. But they did it, and they did it so smoothly and quickly that volunteers actually heard the missing information being spoken in its proper position.


Of course, with increasing maturity, children shift from realism to idealism, coming to realize that perceptions are merely points of view, that what they see is not necessarily what there is, and that two people may thus have different perceptions of or beliefs about the same thing.


three-and-a-half-pound meat loaf between our ears is not a simple recording device but a remarkably smart computer that gathers information, makes shrewd judgments and even shrewder guesses, and offers us its best interpretations of the way things are. Because those interpretations are usually so good, because they usually bear such a striking resemblance to the world as it is actually constituted, we do not realize that we are seeing an interpretation.


we sometimes pay a steep price for allowing ourselves to lose sight of this fundamental fact, because the mistake we make when we momentarily ignore the filling-in trick and unthinkingly accept the validity of our memories and our perceptions is precisely the same mistake we make when we imagine our futures.

Research suggests that when people make predictions about their reactions to future events, they tend to neglect the fact that their brains have performed the filling-in trick as an integral part of the act of imagination.


As we are about to see, the details that the brain puts in are not nearly as troubling as the details it leaves out.


if a pigeon is put in a cage with two levers that can be briefly illuminated, it can easily learn to press the illuminated lever to get a reward of bird seed–but it can never learn to press the unilluminated lever to receive the same reward.3 Pigeons have no trouble figuring out that the presence of a light signals an opportunity for eating, but they cannot learn the same thing about the absence of a light. Research suggests that human beings are a bit like pigeons in this regard. For example, volunteers in one study played a deduction game in which they were shown a set of trigrams (i.e., three-letter combinations such as SXY, GTR, BCG and EVX). The experimenter then pointed to one of the trigrams and told the volunteers that this trigram was special. The volunteers’ job was to figure out what made the trigram special–that is, to figure out which feature of the special trigram distinguished it from the others. Volunteers saw set after set, and each time the experimenter pointed out the special one. How many sets did volunteers have to see before they deduced the distinctive feature of the special trigram? For half the volunteers, the special trigram was distinguished by the fact that it and only it contained the letter T, and these volunteers needed to see about thirty-four sets of trigrams before they figured out that the presence of T is what made a trigram special. For the other half of the volunteers, the special trigram was always distinguished by the fact that it and only it lacked the letter T. The results were astounding. No matter how many sets of trigrams they saw, none of the volunteers ever figured this out.4 It was easy to notice the presence of a letter but, like the barking of a dog, it was impossible to notice its absence.


But studies show that when ordinary people want to know whether two things are causally related, they routinely search for, attend to, consider and remember information about what did happen and fail to search for, attend to, consider and remember information about what did not.


Because when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes. Extremia has the most positive attributes and the most negative attributes, hence people tend to select it when they are looking for something to select and they reject it when they are looking for something to reject. Of course, the logical way to select a holiday is to consider both the presence and the absence of positive and negative attributes, but that’s not what most of us do.


No one can imagine everything, of course, and it would be absurd to suggest that they should. But just as we tend to treat the details of future events that we do imagine as though they were actually going to happen, we have an equally troubling tendency to treat the details of future events that we don’t imagine as though they were not going to happen. In other words, we fail to consider how much imagination fills in, but we also fail to consider how much it leaves out.


It is difficult to escape the focus of our own attention–difficult to consider what it is we may not be considering–and this is one of the reasons why we so often mispredict our emotional responses to future events.


About fifty years ago a Pygmy named Kenge took his first trip out of the dense, tropical forests of Africa and onto the open plains in the company of an anthropologist. Buffalo appeared in the distance–small black specks against a bleached sky–and the Pygmy surveyed them curiously. Finally, he turned to the anthropologist and asked what kind of insects they were. ‘When I told Kenge that the insects were buffalo, he roared with laughter and told me not to tell such stupid lies.’16 The anthropologist wasn’t stupid and he hadn’t lied. Rather, because Kenge had lived his entire life in a dense jungle that offered no views of the horizon, he had failed to learn what most of us take for granted, namely, that things look different when they are far away.


Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time.


When we perceive a distant buffalo, our brains are aware of the fact that the buffalo looks smooth, vague and lacking in detail because it is far away, and they do not mistakenly conclude that the buffalo itself is smooth and vague. But when we remember or imagine a temporally distant event, our brains seem to overlook the fact that details vanish with temporal distance, and they conclude instead that the distant events actually are as smooth and vague as we are imagining and remembering them.


when we said yes we were thinking about babysitting in terms of why instead of how, in terms of causes and consequences instead of execution, and we failed to consider the fact that the detail-free babysitting we were imagining would not be the detail-laden babysitting we would ultimately experience.


people imagine a near-future pain as so severe that they will gladly pay a dollar to avoid it, but a far-future pain as so mild that they will gladly accept a dollar to endure it.


Why does this happen? The vivid detail of the near future makes it much more palpable than the far future, thus we feel more anxious and excited when we imagine events that will take place soon than when we imagine events that will take place later.


we tend to accept the brain’s products uncritically and expect the future to unfold with the details–and with only the details–that the brain has imagined. One of imagination’s shortcomings, then, is that it takes liberties without telling us it has done so.


the past is a wall with some holes, the future is a hole with no walls. Memory uses the filling-in trick, but imagination is the filling-in trick, and if the present lightly colours our remembered pasts, it thoroughly infuses our imagined futures. More simply said, most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want or feel differently than we do now.


Curiosity is a powerful urge, but when you aren’t smack-dab in the middle of feeling it, it’s hard to imagine just how far and fast it can drive you.


brain imagines, namely, that it enlists the aid of its sensory areas when it wants to imagine the sensible features of the world. If we want to know how a particular object looks when the object isn’t sitting there in front of us, we send information about the object from our memory to our visual cortex, and we experience a mental image. Similarly, if we want to know how a melody sounds when it isn’t currently on the radio, we send information about the object from our memory to our auditory cortex,


Prefeeling often allows us to predict our emotions better than logical thinking


Career counsellors and financial advisors always tell us that we should think long and hard if we wish to make sound decisions, but when the researchers phoned the volunteers later and asked how much they liked their new objet d’art, the thinkers were the least satisfied.


when we ask our brains to look at a real object and an imaginary object at the same time, our brains typically grant the first request and turn down the second. The brain considers the perception of reality to be its first and foremost duty, thus your request to borrow the visual cortex for a moment is expressly and summarily denied. If the brain

If you’ve ever fallen asleep one night with the television blaring and been awakened another night by a single footstep, then you already know the answer. The human brain is not particularly sensitive to the absolute magnitude of stimulation, but it is extraordinarily sensitive to differences and changes–that is, to the relative magnitude of stimulation.


Our sensitivity to relative rather than absolute magnitudes is not limited to physical properties such as weight, brightness or volume. It extends to subjective properties, such as value, goodness and worth as well.18


fundamental inability to take the perspective of the person to whom the rest of our lives will happen is the most insidious problem a futurian can face.

Two vertical lines with a crossbar mean one thing when flanked by T and £ and they mean another thing when flanked by C and T, and one of the many things that distinguishes us from rats and pigeons is that we respond to the meanings of such stimuli and not to the stimuli themselves. That’s why my father can get away with calling me “doodlebug” and you can’t.


we respond to meanings–and context, frequency and recency are three of the factors that determine which meaning we will infer when we encounter an ambiguous stimulus. But there is another factor of equal importance and greater interest. Like rats and pigeons, each of us has desires, wishes and needs. We are not merely spectators of the world but investors in it, and we often prefer that an ambiguous stimulus mean one thing rather than another. Consider,


why is it that you think of yourself as a talented person? (Come on, admit it. You know you do.) To answer this question, researchers asked some volunteers (definers) to write down their definition of talented and then to estimate their talent using that definition as a guide.18 Next, some other volunteers (non-definers) were given the definitions that the first group had written down and were asked to estimate their own talent using those definitions as a guide. Interestingly, the definers rated themselves as more talented than the nondefiners did. Because definers were given the liberty to define the word talented any way they wished, they defined it exactly the way they wished–namely, in terms of some activity at which they just so happened to excel


‘It is clear,’ he said, ‘that things cannot be other than the way they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. For instance, noses were made to support spectacles, hence we wear spectacles. Legs, as anyone can see, were made for breeches, and so we wear breeches. Stones were made to be shaped into castles; thus My Lord has a fine castle because the greatest baron in the province ought to have the finest house. And because pigs were made to be eaten, we eat pork all year round. So those who say that everything is well are speaking foolishly; they should say that everything is best.’


If we were to experience the world exactly as it is, we’d be too depressed to get out of bed in the morning, but if we were to experience the world exactly as we want it to be, we’d be too deluded to find our slippers.


We may see the world through rose-coloured glasses, but rose-coloured glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can’t be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it–to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, feed babies and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can’t be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (‘I’m sure this thing will fly’), plant the corn (‘This year will be a banner crop’) and tolerate the babies (‘What a bundle of joy!’). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influence of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate.


You might need to explain that you do not personally know the facts to which you are pointing, but that you do know that at some time in the past, a bunch of very earnest people in white lab coats went out and observed the world with stethoscopes, telescopes and microscopes, wrote down what they observed, analysed what they wrote down and then told the rest of us what to believe about nutrition, cosmology and biology.


How do we manage to think of ourselves as great drivers, talented lovers and brilliant chefs when the facts of our lives include a pathetic parade of dented cars, disappointed partners and deflated soufflés? The answer is simple: we cook the facts.


Decades of research suggests that when it comes to collecting and analysing facts about ourselves and our experiences, most of us have the equivalent of an advanced degree in Really Bad Science.

Although volunteers helped their friends when the test was described as a game, they actively hindered their friends when the test was described as an important measure of intellectual ability. Apparently,


the brain and the eye may have a contractual relationship in which the brain has agreed to believe what the eye sees, but in return the eye has agreed to look for what the brain wants.


When Democrats and Republicans see the same presidential debate on television, both sets of viewers claim that the facts clearly show that their candidate was the winner.44 When pro-Israeli and pro-Arab viewers see identical samples of Middle East news coverage, both proponents claim that the facts clearly show that the press was biased against their side.45 Alas, the only thing these facts clearly show is that people tend to see what they want to see.


Although the word fact seems to suggest a sort of unquestionable irrefutability, facts are actually nothing more than conjectures that have met a certain standard of proof. If we set that standard high enough, then nothing can ever be proved, including the ‘fact’ of our own existence.

The volunteers placed a drop of their saliva on a strip of ordinary paper that the researchers falsely claimed was a medical test strip. Some volunteers (positive-testers) were told that if the strip turned green in ten to sixty seconds, then they had the enzyme deficiency. Other volunteers (negative-testers) were told that if the strip turned green in ten to sixty seconds, then they didn’t have the enzyme deficiency. Although the strip was an ordinary piece of paper and hence never turned green, the negative-testers waited much longer than the positive-testers before deciding that the test was complete. In other words, the volunteers gave the test strip plenty of time to prove that they were well but much less time to prove that they were ill. Apparently it doesn’t take much to convince us that we are smart and healthy, but it takes a whole lotta facts to convince us of the opposite.


we may live at the fulcrum of reality and illusion, but most of us don’t know our own address.


research suggests that people are typically unaware of the reasons why they are doing what they are doing,1 but when asked for a reason, they readily supply one.


For positive views to be credible, they must be based on facts that we believe we have come upon honestly. We accomplish this by unconsciously cooking the facts and then consciously consuming them. The diner is in the dining room, but the chef is in the basement. The benefit of all this unconscious cookery is that it works; but the cost is that it makes us strangers to ourselves.


Like so many things, getting jilted is more painful in prospect and more rosy in retrospect.


most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions.


in the long run, people of every age and in every walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did, which is why the most popular regrets include not going to college, not grasping profitable business opportunities and not spending enough time with family and friends.

One reason is that the psychological immune system has a more difficult time manufacturing positive and credible views of inactions than of actions.21 When our action causes us to accept


Terrorism is a strategy based on the idea that the best offence is the one that fails to trigger the best defence,


research shows that when people are given electric shocks, they actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value. 23 The intense shocks were unpleasant enough to trigger the volunteers’ psychological defences, but the mild shocks were not, hence the volunteers valued the club most when its initiation was most painful.


Why do we overlook an employee’s chronic tardiness but refuse to hire a job seeker who is two minutes late for the interview? One possibility is that blood is thicker than water, flags were made to be rallied around and first impressions matter most. But another possibility is that we are more likely to look for and find a positive view of the things we’re stuck with than of the things we’re not.


It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience, which


We are awed by a solar eclipse but merely impressed by a sunset despite the fact that the latter is by far the more spectacular visual treat.


Explanation robs events of their emotional impact because it makes them seem likely and allows us to stop thinking about them.


We are more likely to generate a positive and credible view of an action than an inaction, of a painful experience than of an annoying experience, of an unpleasant situation that we cannot escape than of one we can.


We’ve seen how difficult it is to predict accurately our emotional reactions to future events because it is difficult to imagine them as they will happen, and difficult to imagine how we’ll think about them once they do. Throughout this book, I’ve compared imagination to perception and memory, and I’ve tried to convince you that foresight is just as fallible as eyesight and hindsight. Fallible eyesight can be remedied by glasses and fallible hindsight can be remedied by written records of the past–but what of fallible foresight? There are no spectacles that can sharpen our view of tomorrow and no records of things to come. Can we remedy the problems of foresight?

Experience, O, thou disprov’st report! Shakespeare, Cymbeline


There are many good things about getting older, but no one knows what they are.


We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment and regret.1 The trouble is that we often don’t remember them correctly.


Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it.


if I really did have bad karma, bad juju or some other metaphysical form of badness that caused any queue I joined to slow down–then there would have to be someone out there who felt that they had a metaphysical form of goodness that caused any queue they joined to speed up. After all, everyone can’t get in the slowest queue on every occasion, can they? And yet, nobody I know feels that they have the power to quicken queues by joining them. On the contrary, just about everyone I know seems to believe that they, like me, are inexorably drawn to the slowest of all possible queues, and that their occasional attempts to thwart fate merely slow the queues they join and hasten the queues they abandon. Why do we all believe this? Because standing in a queue that is moving at a rapid pace, or even an average pace, is such a mind-numbingly ordinary experience that we don’t notice or remember it.


The fact that the least likely experience is often the most likely memory can wreak havoc with our ability to predict future experiences.


Whether we hear a series of sounds, read a series of letters, see a series of pictures, smell a series of odours, or meet a series of people, we show a pronounced tendency to recall the items at the end of the series far better than the items at the beginning or in the middle.


‘The setting sun, and music at the close / As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last / Writ in remembrance more than things long past.’


few months after the election was decided, both groups of voters remembered feeling as they had expected to feel, and not as they had actually felt. Apparently, prospections and retrospections can be in perfect agreement despite the fact that neither accurately describes our actual experience.


Instructed by the antiquary times, He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.

If you were to write down everything you know and then go back through the list and make a check mark next to the things you know only because somebody told you, you’d develop a repetitive-motion disorder because almost everything you know is secondhand.


There are just two possibilities. The first is that a lot of the advice we receive from others is bad advice that we foolishly accept. The second is that a lot of the advice we receive from others is good advice that we foolishly reject. So which is it? Do we listen too well when others speak, or do we not listen well enough? As we shall see, the answer to that question is yes.


As Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, wrote in 1776: ‘The desire for food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniences and ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems to have no limit or certain boundary.’


Federal Reserve may wake up every morning with a desire to do what the economy wants, but most of us get up with a desire to do what we want, which is to say that the fundamental needs of a vibrant economy and the fundamental needs of a happy individual are not necessarily the same.


Like so many thinkers, Smith believed that people want just one thing–happiness–hence economies can blossom and grow only if people are deluded into believing that the production of wealth will make them happy.


I’ve claimed that when we imagine our futures we tend to fill in, leave out and take little account of how differently we will think about the future once we actually get there. I’ve claimed that neither personal experience nor cultural wisdom compensates for imagination’s shortcomings.


experience of a single randomly selected individual can sometimes provide a better basis for predicting your future experience than your own imagination can. And then let me show you why you–and I–find this so difficult to believe. Finding


when people are deprived of the information that imagination requires and are thus forced to use others as surrogates, they make remarkably accurate predictions about their future feelings, which suggests that the best way to predict our feelings tomorrow is to see how others are feeling today.


Because if you are like most people, then like most people, you don’t know you’re like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts is that the average person doesn’t see herself as average. Most


Ironically, the bias toward seeing ourselves as better than average causes us to see ourselves as less biased than average too.


As one research team concluded, ‘Most of us appear to believe that we are more athletic, intelligent, organized, ethical, logical, interesting, fair-minded, and healthy–not to mention more attractive–than the average person.’


We don’t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique.


We don’t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we’re doing it for unique reasons. For


We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways40 If you’ve ever shown up at a party and found someone else wearing exactly the same dress or tie that you were wearing, then you know how unsettling it is to share the room with an unwanted twin whose presence temporarily diminishes your sense of individuality.

tend to think of people as more different from one another than they actually are. Let’s face it: all people are similar in some ways and different in others. The psychologists, biologists, economists and sociologists who are searching for universal laws of human behavior naturally care about the similarities, but the rest of us care mainly about the differences.


The irony, of course, is that surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict one’s future emotions, but because we don’t realize just how similar we all are, we reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as flawed and fallible as they may be.


The determination of the value of an item must not be based on its price, but rather on the utility it yields. The price of the item is dependent only on the thing itself and is equal for everyone; the utility, however, is dependent on the particular circumstances of the person making the estimate. Thus there is no doubt that a gain of one thousand ducats is more significant to a pauper than to a rich man though both gain the same amount.


When we imagine future circumstances, we fill in details that won’t really come to pass and leave out details that will. When we imagine future feelings, we find it impossible to ignore what we are feeling now and impossible to recognize


When we imagine future circumstances, we fill in details that won’t really come to pass and leave out details that will. When we imagine future feelings, we find it impossible to ignore what we are feeling now and impossible to recognize how we will think about the things that happen later. Daniel

The first author to notice this was Plato, who used this fact to make his case for an objective measurement of happiness: ‘Do not the same magnitudes appear larger to your sight when near, and smaller when at a distance? … Now suppose happiness to consist in doing or choosing the greater, and in not doing or in avoiding the less, what would be the saving principle of human life? Would not the art of measuring be the saving principle; or would the power of appearance? Is not the latter that deceiving art which makes us wander up and down and take the things at one time of which we repent at another, both in our actions and in our choice of things great and small?’ O. Jowett, Plato: Protagoras, facsimile edn. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1956).

We don’t realize the role of these Swans in life because of this illusion of predictability. Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory—our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness.


The record shows that, for society, the richer we become, the harder it gets to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.


It is said that the best horses lose when they compete with slower ones, and win against better rivals. Undercompensation from the absence of a stressor, inverse hormesis, absence of challenge, degrades the best of the best.


This mechanism of overcompensation hides in the most unlikely places. If tired after an intercontinental flight, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting. Also, it is a well-known trick that if you need something urgently done, give the task to the busiest (or second busiest) person in the office.


“disfluency.” Mental effort moves us into higher gear, activating more vigorous and more analytical brain machinery.


It is all about redundancy. Nature likes to overinsure itself. Layers of redundancy are the central risk management property of natural systems.

It is quite perplexing that those from whom we have benefited the most aren’t those who have tried to help us (say with “advice”) but rather those who have actively tried—but eventually failed—to harm us.


Can the occurrence of extreme events be predicted from past history? Alas, according to a simple test: no, sorry.


your bones will get denser when episodic stress is applied to them,


Inanimate—that is, nonliving—material, typically, when subjected to stress, either undergoes material fatigue or breaks. One of the rare exceptions I’ve seen is in the report of a 2011 experiment by Brent Carey, a graduate student, in which he shows that composite material of carbon nanotubes arranged in a certain manner produces a self-strengthening response previously unseen in synthetic materials, “similar to the localized self-strengthening that occurs in biological structures.” This crosses the boundary between the living and the inanimate, as it can lead to the development of adaptable load-bearing material.


For instance, some markers, such as blood pressure, that tend to worsen over time for moderns do not change over the life of hunter-gatherers until the very end. And this artificial aging comes from stifling internal antifragility.

loss of bone density and degradation of the health of the bones also causes aging, diabetes, and, for males, loss of fertility and sexual function.


touristification. This is my term for an aspect of modern life that treats humans as washing machines, with simplified mechanical responses—and a detailed user’s manual.


If you are not a washing machine or a cuckoo clock—in other words, if you are alive—something deep in your soul likes a certain measure of randomness and disorder.


Few objects bring more thrill than a recovered wallet (or laptop) lost on a train. Further, in an ancestral habitat we humans were prompted by natural stimuli—fear, hunger, desire—that made us work out and become fit for our environment. Consider how easy it is to find the energy to lift a car if a crying child is under it, or to run for your life if you see a wild animal crossing the street. Compare this to the heaviness of the obligation to visit the gym at the planned 6 P.M. and be bullied there by some personal trainer—unless of course you are under the imperative to look like a bodyguard.

Ancestral life had no homework, no boss, no civil servants, no academic grades, no conversation with the dean, no consultant with an MBA, no table of procedure, no application form, no trip to New Jersey, no grammatical stickler, no conversation with someone boring you: all life was random stimuli and nothing, good or bad, ever felt like work.3 Dangerous, yes, but boring, never.


The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.


Restaurants are fragile; they compete with each other, but the collective of local restaurants is antifragile for that very reason. Had restaurants been individually robust, hence immortal, the overall business would be either stagnant or weak, and would deliver nothing better than cafeteria food—and I mean Soviet-style cafeteria food. Further, it would be marred with systemic shortages, with, once in a while, a complete crisis and government bailout.


Or the organism itself might be fragile, but the information encoded in the genes reproducing it will be antifragile. The point is not trivial, as it is behind the logic of evolution. This applies equally to entrepreneurs and individual scientific researchers.


In fact, the most interesting aspect of evolution is that it only works because of its antifragility; it is in love with stressors, randomness, uncertainty, and disorder—while individual organisms are relatively fragile, the gene pool takes advantage of shocks to enhance its fitness.


Everything alive or organic in nature has a finite life and dies eventually—even Methuselah lived less than a thousand years. But it usually dies after reproducing offspring with a genetic code in one way or another different from that of the parents, with their information modified.


Nature prefers to let the game continue at the informational level, the genetic code.


Nature prefers to let the game continue at the informational level, the genetic code. So organisms need to die for nature to be antifragile—nature is opportunistic, ruthless, and selfish.


with evolution, something hierarchically superior to that organism benefits from the damage. From the outside, it looks like there is hormesis, but from the inside, there are winners and losers.


When you starve yourself of food, it is the bad proteins that are broken down first and recycled by your own body—a process called autophagy. This is a purely evolutionary process, one that selects and kills the weakest for fitness.


Now we get into errors and how the errors of some people carry benefits for others.


the random element in trial and error is not quite random, if it is carried out rationally, using error as a source of information. If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution—so every attempt becomes more valuable, more like an expense than an error.

If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution—so every attempt becomes more valuable, more like an expense than an error. And of course you make discoveries along the way.


There are hundreds of thousands of plane flights every year, and a crash in one plane does not involve others, so errors remain confined and highly epistemic—whereas globalized economic systems operate as one: errors spread and compound.


my errors lifting stones, when I am well calibrated, translate into small injuries that guide me the next time, as I try to avoid pain—after all, that’s the purpose of pain.


Both your failures and your successes will give you information. But, and this is one of the good things in life, sometimes you only know about someone’s character after you harm them with an error for which you are solely responsible—I have been astonished at the generosity of some persons in the way they forgave me for my mistakes.

And of course you learn from the errors of others. You may never know what type of person someone is unless they are given opportunities to violate moral or ethical codes.


my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on.


He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors—though never the same error more than once—is more reliable than someone who has never made any.


with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other business.

This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing—and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness. Artisans, say, taxi drivers, prostitutes (a very, very old profession), carpenters, plumbers, tailors, and dentists, have some volatility in their income but they are rather robust to a minor professional Black Swan, one that would bring their income to a complete halt. Their risks are visible. Not so with employees, who have no volatility, but can be surprised to see their income going to zero after a phone call from the personnel department. Employees’ risks are hidden.


A week with declining earnings for a taxi driver or a prostitute provides information concerning the environment and intimates the need to find a new part of town where clients hang around; a month or so without earnings drives them to revise their skills.


This great variety of people and their wallets are there, in Switzerland, for its shelter, safety, and stability. But all these refugees don’t notice the obvious: the most stable country in the world does not have a government. And it is not stable in spite of not having a government; it is stable because it does not have one. Ask random Swiss citizens to name their president, and count the proportion of people who can do so—they can usually name the presidents of France or the United States but not their own.

Eye contact with one’s peers changes one’s behavior. But for a desk-grounded office leech, a number is a just a number. Someone you see in church Sunday morning would feel uncomfortable for his mistakes—and more responsible for them. On the small, local scale, his body and biological response would direct him to avoid causing harm to others. On a large scale, others are abstract items; given the lack of social contact with the people concerned, the civil servant’s brain leads rather than his emotions—with numbers, spreadsheets, statistics,


Also consider that lobbyists—this annoying race of lobbyists—cannot exist in a municipality or small region. The Europeans, thanks to the centralization of (some) power with the European Commission in Brussels, are quickly discovering the existence of these mutants coming to manipulate democracy for the sake of some large corporation. By influencing one single decision or regulation in Brussels, a single lobbyist gets a large bang. It is a much larger payoff (at low cost) than with municipalities, which would require armies of lobbyists trying to convince people while embedded in their communities.


it is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations. Its system, even in banking during my days, was based on apprenticeship models, nearly vocational rather than the theoretical ones. In other words, on techne (crafts and know how), not episteme (book knowledge, know what).


planning tends to fail precisely because of these attributes—it is quite a myth that planning helps corporations: in fact we saw that the world is too random and unpredictable to base a policy on visibility of the future. What survives comes from the interplay of some fitness and environmental conditions.


A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys “with increased statistical confidence.” The butcher will keep feeding the turkey until a few days before Thanksgiving. Then comes that day when it is really not a very good idea to be a turkey. So with the butcher surprising it, the turkey will have a revision of belief—right when its confidence in the statement that the butcher loves turkeys is maximal and “it is very quiet” and soothingly predictable in the life of the turkey. This example builds on an adaptation of a metaphor by Bertrand Russell. The key here is that such a surprise will be a Black Swan event; but just for the turkey, not for the butcher.


The northern Levant, roughly today’s northern part of Syria and Lebanon, stayed perhaps the most prosperous province in the history of mankind, over the long, very long stretch of time from the pre-pottery Neolithic until very modern history, the middle of the twentieth century. That’s twelve thousand years—compared to, say, England, which has been prosperous for about five hundred years, or Scandinavia, now only prosperous for less than three hundred years.


Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated.


Some people have fallen for the naive turkey-style belief that the world is getting safer and safer, and of course they naively attribute it to the holy “state” (though bottom-up Switzerland has about the lowest rate of violence of any place on the planet).

A donkey equally famished and thirsty caught at an equal distance between food and water would unavoidably die of hunger or thirst. But he can be saved thanks to a random nudge one way or the other. This metaphor is named Buridan’s Donkey, after the medieval philosopher Jean de Buridan, who—among other, very complicated things—introduced the thought experiment. When some systems are stuck in a dangerous impasse, randomness and only randomness can unlock them and set them free.


By a mechanism called stochastic resonance, adding random noise to the background makes you hear the sounds (say, music) with more accuracy.


Consider the method of annealing in metallurgy, a technique used to make metal stronger and more homogeneous. It involves the heating and controlled cooling of a material, to increase the size of the crystals and reduce their defects. Just as with Buridan’s donkey, the heat causes the atoms to become unstuck from their initial positions and wander randomly through states of higher energy; the cooling gives them more chances of finding new, better configurations.


Inspired by the metallurgical technique, mathematicians use a method of computer simulation called simulated annealing to bring more general optimal solutions to problems and situations, solutions that only randomness can deliver.


And, ironically, the so-called chaotic systems, those experiencing a brand of variations called chaos, can be stabilized by adding randomness to them. I watched an eerie demonstration of the effects, presented by a doctoral student who first got balls to jump chaotically on a table in response to steady vibrations on the surface. These steady shocks made the balls jump in a jumbled and inelegant manner. Then, as by magic, he moved a switch and the jumps became orderly and smooth. The magic is that such change of regime, from chaos to order, did not take place by removing chaos, but by adding random, completely random but low-intensity shocks. I came out of the beautiful experiment with so much enthusiasm that I wanted to inform strangers on the street, “I love randomness!”


One of the methods, called sortes virgilianae (fate as decided by the epic poet Virgil), involved opening Virgil’s Aeneid at random and interpreting the line that presented itself as direction for the course of action. You should use such method for every sticky business decision. I will repeat until I get hoarse: the ancients evolved hidden and sophisticated ways and tricks to exploit randomness. For instance, I actually practice such randomizing heuristic in restaurants.


We are moving into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very, very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization (or rather reinvention of new sacred values like flags to replace altars), the tax man, fear of the boss, spending the weekend in interesting places and the workweek in a putatively less interesting one, the separation of “work” and “leisure” (though the two would look identical to someone from a wiser era), the retirement plan, argumentative intellectuals who would disagree with this definition of modernity, literal thinking, inductive inference, philosophy of science, the invention of social science, smooth surfaces, and egocentric architects.

We will posit in Chapter 21 that every time you visit a doctor and get a treatment, you incur risks of such medical harm, which should be analyzed the way we analyze other trade-offs: probabilistic benefits minus probabilistic costs.


Thank you, modernity: it was “scientific progress,” the birth of the clinic and its substitution for home remedies, that caused death rates to shoot up, mostly from what was then called “hospital fever”—Leibniz had called these hospitals seminaria mortis, seedbeds of


Thank you, modernity: it was “scientific progress,” the birth of the clinic and its substitution for home remedies, that caused death rates to shoot up, mostly from what was then called “hospital fever”—Leibniz had called these hospitals seminaria mortis, seedbeds of death.


And the final lesson is that one should not expect laurels for bringing the truth.


medical error still currently kills between three times (as accepted by doctors) and ten times as many people as car accidents in the United States. It is generally accepted that harm from doctors—not including risks from hospital germs—accounts for more deaths than any single cancer.


For a theory is a very dangerous thing to have. And of course one can rigorously do science without it. What scientists call phenomenology is the observation of an empirical regularity without a visible theory for it. In the Triad, I put theories in the fragile

In the Triad, I put theories in the fragile category, phenomenology in the robust one. Theories are superfragile; they come and go, then come and go, then come and go again; phenomenologies stay, and I can’t believe people don’t realize that phenomenology is “robust” and usable, and theories, while overhyped, are unreliable for decision making—outside physics.


The very designation “theory” is even upsetting. In social science we should call these constructs “chimeras” rather than theories.


if you supply a typical copy editor with a text, he will propose a certain number of edits, say about five changes per page. Now accept his “corrections” and give this text to another copy editor who tends to have the same average rate of intervention (editors vary in interventionism), and you will see that he will suggest an equivalent number of edits, sometimes reversing changes made by the previous editor. Find a third editor, same.


Some libertarians use the example of Drachten, a town in the Netherlands, in which a dream experiment was conducted. All street signs were removed. The deregulation led to an increase in safety, confirming the antifragility of attention at work, how it is whetted by a sense of danger and responsibility. As a result, many German and Dutch towns have reduced the number of street signs.


There is a Latin expression festina lente, “make haste slowly.” The Romans were not the only ancients to respect the act of voluntary omission. The Chinese thinker Lao Tzu coined the doctrine of wu-wei, “passive achievement.”


Granted, in the modern world, my tax return is not going to take care of itself—but by delaying a non-vital visit to a doctor, or deferring the writing of a passage until my body tells me that I am ready for it, I may be using a very potent naturalistic filter.


Psychologists and economists who study “irrationality” do not realize that humans may have an instinct to procrastinate only when no life is in danger. I do not procrastinate when I see a lion entering my bedroom or fire in my neighbor’s library.


we humans are very bad at filtering information, particularly short-term information, and procrastination can be a way for us to filter better, to resist the consequences of jumping on information, as we discuss next.

we humans are very bad at filtering information, particularly short-term information, and procrastination can be a way for us to filter better, to resist the consequences of jumping on information, as we discuss next. This idea of “naturalistic” has led to confusion. Philosophers refer to an error called the naturalistic fallacy, implying that what is natural is not necessarily morally right—something I subscribe to, as we saw in Chapter 4 in the discussion of the problem of applying Darwinian selection to modern society and the need to protect those who fail, something counter to nature. (The problem is that some people misuse the naturalistic fallacy outside the moral domain and misapply it to this idea of reliance on naturalistic instinct when one is in doubt.) However one slices it, it is not a fallacy when it comes to risk considerations. Time is the best test of fragility—it encompasses high doses of disorder—and nature is the only system that has been stamped “robust” by time.


Imagine someone of the type we call neurotic in common parlance. He is wiry, looks contorted, and speaks with an uneven voice. His neck moves around when he tries to express himself. When he has a small pimple, his first reaction is to assume that it is cancerous, that the cancer is of the lethal type, and that it has already spread to his lymph nodes. His hypochondria is not limited to the medical department: he incurs a small setback in business and reacts as if bankruptcy were both near and certain. In the office, he is tuned to every single possible detail, systematically transforming every molehill into a mountain. The last thing you want in life is to be stuck in traffic with him on your way to an important appointment.

Compare him to someone imperturbable, with the ability to be calm under fire that is considered necessary to become a leader, military commander, or mafia godfather. Usually unruffled and immune to small information, he can impress you with his self-control in difficult circumstances. For a sample of a composed, calm, and pondered voice, listen to interviews with “Sammy the Bull,” Salvatore Gravano, who was involved in the murder of nineteen people (all competing mobsters). He speaks with minimal effort, as if what he is discussing is “not a big deal.” This second type sometimes reacts when necessary; in the rare situations when he is angry, unlike with the neurotic fellow, everyone knows it and takes it seriously. The supply of information to which we are exposed thanks to modernity is transforming humans from the equable second fellow into the neurotic first one.

The difference between the two fellows will show us the difference between noise and signal. Noise is what you are supposed to ignore, signal what you need to heed.

In business and economic decision making, reliance on data causes severe side effects—data is now plentiful thanks to connectivity, and the proportion of spuriousness in the data increases as one gets more immersed in it. A very rarely discussed property of data: it is toxic in large quantities—even in moderate quantities.


you can use and take advantage of noise and randomness; but noise and randomness can also use and take advantage of you, particularly when totally unnatural, as with the data you get on the Web or through the media. The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you are disproportionally likely to get (rather than the valuable part, called the signal); hence the higher the noise-to-signal ratio.

the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information, as naturalistically as possible.


Dmitri Orlov showed how calamities were avoided after the breakdown of the Soviet state because food production was inefficient and full of unintentional redundancies, which ended up working in favor of stability. Stalin played with agriculture, causing his share of famine. But he and his successors never managed to get agriculture to become “efficient,” that is, centralized and optimized as it is today in America, so every town had the staples growing around it. This was costlier, as they did not get the benefits of specialization, but this local lack of specialization allowed people to have access to all varieties of food in spite of the severe breakdown of the institutions. In the United States, we burn twelve calories in transportation for every calorie of nutrition; in Soviet Russia, it was one to one.

In a thick and captivating book, La rebellion française, the historian Jean Nicolas shows how the culture of rioting was extremely sophisticated—historically, it counts as the true French national sport.


our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is not close to zero; it is zero.


There are ample empirical findings to the effect that providing someone with a random numerical forecast increases his risk taking, even if the person knows the projections are random.


if you have extra cash in the bank (in addition to stockpiles of tradable goods such as cans of Spam and hummus and gold bars in the basement), you don’t need to know with precision which event will cause potential difficulties.1 It could be a war, a revolution, an earthquake, a recession, an epidemic, a terrorist attack, the secession of the state of New Jersey, anything—you do not need to predict much, unlike those who are in the opposite situation, namely, in debt. Those, because of their fragility, need to predict with more, a lot more, accuracy.


The limit is mathematical, period, and there is no way around it on this planet. What is nonmeasurable and nonpredictable will remain nonmeasurable and nonpredictable, no matter how many PhDs with Russian and Indian names you put on the job—and no matter how much hate mail I get. There is, in the Black Swan zone, a limit to knowledge that can never be reached, no matter how sophisticated statistical and risk management science ever gets.


Our sophistication continuously puts us ahead of ourselves, creating things we are less and less capable of understanding.


And, as he discovered, the worst thing one can do to feel one knows things a bit deeper is to try to go into them a bit deeper. The sea gets deeper as you go further into it, according to a Venetian proverb.

Harvard libraries,1 with close to two million books and research papers, for a total of 33 million hours of reading, close to nine thousand years’ worth of reading as a full-time activity.


wisdom in decision making is vastly more important—not just practically, but philosophically—than knowledge.


To become a successful philosopher king, it is much better to start as a king than as a philosopher,


even more useless probabilities and shmobabilities.


while the Harvard economist is only read by people trying to write papers, who in turn are read by people trying to write papers, and will be (hopefully) swallowed by the inexorable b***t detector of history, Lucius Annaeus, known as Seneca the Younger, is still read by real people two millennia after his passing.


Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain. You are hence fragile.


A rich person becomes trapped by belongings that take control of him, degrading his sleep at night, raising the serum concentration of his stress hormones, diminishing his sense of humor, perhaps even causing hair to grow on the tip of his nose and similar ailments. Seneca fathomed that possessions make us worry about downside, thus acting as a punishment as we depend on them.

Seneca fathomed that possessions make us worry about downside, thus acting as a punishment as we depend on them. All upside, no downside. Even more: dependence on circumstances—rather, the emotions that arise from circumstances—induces a form of slavery.


“Men feel the good less intensely than the bad” (segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt), he wrote half a generation before Seneca.


Livy: “Men feel the good less intensely than the bad” (segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt), he wrote half a generation before Seneca.


Seneca’s practical method to counter such fragility was to go through mental exercises to write off possessions, so when losses occurred he would not feel the sting—a way to wrest one’s freedom from circumstances.


difference between Buddhism and Stoicism, I have a simple answer. A Stoic is a Buddhist with attitude, one who says “f*** you” to fate.


The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside; that is, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans and letting natural antifragility work by itself.


As Publilius Syrus wrote, nothing can be done both hastily and safely—almost nothing.


The barbell (a bar with weights on both ends that weight lifters use) is meant to illustrate the idea of a combination of extremes kept separate, with avoidance of the middle.


If you put 90 percent of your funds in boring cash (assuming you are protected from inflation) or something called a “numeraire repository of value,” and 10 percent in very risky, maximally risky, securities, you cannot possibly lose more than 10 percent, while you are exposed to massive upside.


A barbell can be any dual strategy composed of extremes, without the corruption of the middle—somehow


A barbell can be any dual strategy composed of extremes, without the corruption of the middle—somehow they all result in favorable asymmetries.


More barbells. Do crazy things (break furniture once in a while), like the Greeks during the later stages of a drinking symposium, and stay “rational” in larger decisions. Trashy gossip magazines and classics or sophisticated works; never middlebrow stuff. Talk to either undergraduate students, cab drivers, and gardeners or the highest caliber scholars; never to middling-but-career-conscious academics. If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.


“An agent does not move except out of intention for an end,” agen autem non movet nisi ex intentione finis.


“An agent does not move except out of intention for an end,” is where the most pervasive human error lies, compounded by two or more centuries of the illusion of unconditional scientific understanding. This error is also the most fragilizing one.


Like Britain in the Industrial Revolution, America’s asset is, simply, risk taking and the use of optionality, this remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing, starting again, and repeating failure. In modern Japan, by contrast, shame comes with failure, which causes people to hide risks under the rug, financial or nuclear, making small benefits while sitting on dynamite, an attitude that strangely contrasts with their traditional respect for fallen heroes and the so-called nobility of failure.


The option is an agent of antifragility.


And if you make more when you are right than you are hurt when you are wrong, then you will benefit, in the long run, from volatility (and the reverse).

Thales, by funding his own philosophy, became his own Maecenas, perhaps the highest rank one can attain: being both independent and intellectually productive. He now had even more options. He did not have to tell others—those funding him—where he was going, because he himself perhaps didn’t even know where he was heading.


growth in society may not come from raising the average the Asian way, but from increasing the number of people in the “tails,” that small, very small number of risk takers crazy enough to have ideas of their own, those endowed with that very rare ability called imagination, that rarer quality called courage, and who make things happen.


Bricolage is a form of trial and error close to tweaking, trying to make do with what you’ve got by recycling pieces that would be otherwise wasted.


about half of all embryos undergo a spontaneous abortion—easier to do so than design the perfect baby by blueprint. Nature simply keeps what it likes if it meets its standards or does a California-style “fail early”—it has an option and uses it. Nature understands optionality effects vastly better than humans, and certainly better than Aristotle.


An option hides where we don’t want it to hide. I will repeat that options benefit from variability, but also from situations in which errors carry small costs. So these errors are like options—in the long run, happy errors bring gains, unhappy errors bring losses.


“Life is long gamma.” (To repeat, in the jargon, “long” means “benefits from” and “short” “hurt by,” and “gamma” is a name for the nonlinearity of options, so “long gamma” means “benefits from volatility and variability.” Anthony


But the largest generators of wealth in America historically have been, first, real estate (investors have the option at the expense of the banks), and, second, technology (which relies almost completely on trial and error). Further, businesses with negative optionality (that is, the opposite of having optionality) such as banking have had a horrible performance through history: banks lose periodically every penny made in their history thanks to blowups.


For if you think that education causes wealth, rather than being a result of wealth, or that intelligent actions and discoveries are the result of intelligent ideas, you will be in for a surprise. Let us see what kind of surprise.


we had been putting our suitcases on top of a cart with wheels, but nobody thought of putting tiny wheels directly under the suitcase. Can you imagine that it took close to six thousand years between the invention of the wheel (by, we assume, the Mesopotamians) and this brilliant implementation (by some luggage maker in a drab industrial suburb)?


this took place three decades or so after we put a man on the moon. And consider all this sophistication used in sending someone into space, and its totally negligible impact on my life, and compare it to this lactic acid in my arms, pain in my lower back, soreness in the palms of my hands, and sense of helplessness in front of a long corridor.


But the technology is only trivial retrospectively—not prospectively. All those brilliant minds, usually disheveled and rumpled, who go to faraway conferences to discuss Gödel, Shmodel, Riemann’s Conjecture, quarks, shmarks, had to carry their suitcases through airport terminals, without thinking about applying their brain to such an insignificant transportation problem. (We said that the intellectual society rewards “difficult” derivations, compared to practice in which there is no penalty for simplicity.) And even if these brilliant minds had applied their supposedly overdeveloped brains to such an obvious and trivial problem, they probably would not have gotten anywhere.


We humans lack imagination, to the point of not even knowing what tomorrow’s important things look like. We use randomness to spoon-feed us with discoveries—which is why antifragility is necessary.


Sometimes you need a visionary to figure out what to do with a discovery, a vision that he and only he can have. For instance, take the computer mouse, or what is called the graphical interface: it took Steve Jobs to put it on your desk, then laptop—only he had a vision of the dialectic between images and humans—later adding sounds to a trilectic. The things, as they say, that are “staring at us.”


the simpler and more obvious the discovery, the less equipped we are to figure it out by complicated methods. The key is that the significant can only be revealed through practice.


Simplicity, I realized, does not lead to laurels.


Trial and error has one overriding value people fail to understand: it is not really random, rather, thanks to optionality, it requires some rationality. One needs to be intelligent in recognizing the favorable outcome and knowing what to discard.


some things need to break for the system to improve—what is labeled creative destruction—a notion developed, among so many other ones, by the philosopher Karl Marx


Academia → Applied Science and Technology → Practice While this model may be valid in some very narrow (but highly advertised instances), such as building the atomic bomb, the exact reverse seems to be true in most of the domains I’ve examined. Or, at least, this model is not guaranteed to be true and, what is shocking, we have no rigorous evidence that it is true. It may be that academia helps science and technology, which in turn help practice, but in unintended, nonteleological ways, as we will see later (in other words, it is directed research that may well be an illusion).


Yiddish saying: “If the student is smart, the teacher takes the credit.”


directed research would tell you what has worked from funding (like AIDS drugs or some modern designer drugs), not what has failed—so you may have the impression that it fares better than random. And of course iatrogenics is never part of the discourse. They never tell you if education hurt you in some places.

The Soviet-Harvard illusion (lecturing birds on flying and believing that the lecture is the cause of these wonderful skills)


One rarely has the illusion that, given that so many boys have short hair, short hair determines gender, or that wearing a tie causes one to become a businessman. But it is easy to fall into other epiphenomena, particularly when one is immersed in a news-driven culture.

But it is easy to fall into other epiphenomena, particularly when one is immersed in a news-driven culture. And one can easily see the trap of having these epiphenomena fuel action, then justify it retrospectively.


It would seem a reasonable investment if one accepts the notion that university knowledge generates economic wealth. But this is a belief that comes more from superstition than empiricism. Remember the story of Switzerland in Chapter 5—a place with a very low level of formal education.


Recall the quote by Seneca and Ovid to the effect that sophistication is born of need, and success of difficulties—in fact many such variations, sourced in medieval days (such as necessitas magistra in Erasmus), found their way into our daily vernaculars, as in “necessity is the mother of invention.” The best is, as usual, from the master aphorist Publilius Syrus: “poverty makes experiences” (hominem experiri multa paupertas iubet).

But the expression and idea appear in one form or another in so many classical writers, including Euripides, Pseudo-Theoctitus, Plautus, Apuleus, Zenobius, Juvenal, and of course it is now labeled “post-traumatic growth.” I saw ancient wisdom at work in the exact opposite of the situation in Abu Dhabi. My Levantine village of origin, Amioun, was pillaged and evacuated during the war, sending its inhabitants into exile across the planet. Twenty-five years later, it became opulent, having bounced back with a vengeance: my own house, dynamited, is now bigger than the previous version. My father, showing me the multiplication of villas in the countryside while bemoaning these nouveaux riches, calmly told me, “You, too, had you stayed here, would have become a beach bum.

Take the following potent and less-is-more-style argument by the rogue economist Ha-Joon Chang. In 1960 Taiwan had a much lower literacy rate than the Philippines and half the income per person; today Taiwan has ten times the income. At the same time, Korea had a much lower literacy rate than Argentina (which had one of the highest in the world) and about one-fifth the income per person; today it has three times as much.


am not saying that for an individual, education is useless: it builds helpful credentials for one’s own career—but such effect washes out at the country level. Education stabilizes the income of families across generations. A merchant makes money, then his children go to the Sorbonne, they become doctors and magistrates. The family retains wealth because the diplomas allow members to remain in the middle class long after the ancestral wealth is depleted. But these effects don’t count for countries.

This argument is not against adopting governmental educational policies for noble aims such as reducing inequality in the population, allowing the poor to access good literature and read Dickens, Victor Hugo, or Julien Gracq, or increasing the freedom of women in poor countries, which happens to decrease the birth rate. But then one should not use the excuses of “growth” or “wealth” in such matters.


Likewise, in ancient times, learning was for learning’s sake, to make someone a good person, worth talking to, not to increase the stock of gold in the city’s heavily guarded coffers. Entrepreneurs, particularly those in technical jobs, are not necessarily the best people to have dinner with.


Clearly, it is unrigorous to equate skills at doing with skills at talking. My experience of good practitioners is that they can be totally incomprehensible—they do not have to put much energy into turning their insights and internal coherence into elegant style and narratives. Entrepreneurs are selected to be just doers, not thinkers, and doers do, they don’t talk, and it would be unfair, wrong, and downright insulting to measure them in the talk department.


Aside from the non-narrative view of things, another lesson. People with too much smoke and complicated tricks and methods in their brains start missing elementary, very elementary things. Persons in the real world can’t afford to miss these things; otherwise they crash the plane. Unlike researchers, they were selected for survival, not complications. So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things


As Yogi Berra said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice there is.”


An idea does not survive because it is better than the competition, but rather because the person who holds it has survived! Accordingly, wisdom you learn from your grandmother should be vastly superior (empirically, hence scientifically) to what you get from a class in business school (and, of course, considerably cheaper). My sadness is that we have been moving farther and farther away from grandmothers.


antifragile risk taking—not education and formal, organized research—is largely responsible for innovation and growth, while the story is dressed up by textbook writers. It does not mean that theories and research play no role; it is that just as we are fooled by randomness, so we are fooled into overestimating the role of good-sounding ideas.


I have seen evidence—as an eyewitness—of results that owe nothing to academizing science, rather evolutionary tinkering that was dressed up and claimed to have come from academia. Click here for a larger image of this table.


we are quite certain that the Romans, admirable engineers, built aqueducts without mathematics (Roman numerals did not make quantitative analysis very easy). Otherwise, I believe, these would not be here, as a patent side effect of mathematics is making people over-optimize and cut corners, causing fragility. Just look how the new is increasingly more perishable than the old.


The discovery of the Higgs Boson is a modern case of a particle entirely expected from theoretical derivations. So was Einstein’s relativity. (Prior to the Higgs Boson, one spectacular case of a discovery with a small number of existing external data is that of the French astronomer Le Verrier’s derivation of the existence of the planet Neptune.

(Prior to the Higgs Boson, one spectacular case of a discovery with a small number of existing external data is that of the French astronomer Le Verrier’s derivation of the existence of the planet Neptune. He did that on the basis of solitary computation, from the behavior of the surrounding planets. When the planet was actually sighted he refused to look at it, so comfortable was he with his result.

The sociologist of science Steve Shapin, who spent time in California observing venture capitalists, reports that investors tend to back entrepreneurs, not ideas. Decisions are largely a matter of opinion strengthened with “who you know” and “who said what,” as, to use the venture capitalist’s lingo, you bet on the jockey, not the horse.

Decisions are largely a matter of opinion strengthened with “who you know” and “who said what,” as, to use the venture capitalist’s lingo, you bet on the jockey, not the horse. Why? Because innovations drift, and one needs flâneur-like abilities to keep capturing the opportunities that arise, not stay locked up in a bureaucratic mold. The significant venture capital decisions, Shapin showed, were made without real business plans. So if there was any “analysis,” it had to be of a backup, confirmatory nature.


Unlike technology, medicine has a long history of domestication of luck; it now has accepted randomness in its practice. But not quite.


private industry develops nine drugs out of ten. Even the tax-funded National Institutes of Health found that out of forty-six drugs on the market with significant sales, about three had anything to do with federal funding.


the therapeutic revolution, or the period in the postwar years that saw a large number of effective therapies, was not ignited by a major scientific insight. It came from the exact opposite, “the realization by doctors and scientists that it was not necessary to understand in any detail what was wrong, but that synthetic chemistry blindly and randomly would deliver the remedies that had eluded doctors for centuries.”


The more drugs there are on the market, the more interactions with one another—so we end up with a swelling number of possible interactions with every new drug introduced. If there are twenty unrelated drugs, the twenty-first would need to consider twenty interactions, no big deal. But if there are a thousand, we would need to predict a little less than a thousand. And there are tens of thousands of drugs available today. Further, there is research showing that we may be underestimating the interactions of current drugs, those already on the market, by a factor of four so, if anything, the pool of available drugs should be shrinking rather than growing.

In the eyes of Algazel, a skeptic fideist (i.e., a skeptic with religious faith), knowledge was not in the hands of humans, but in those of God, while Adam Smith calls it the law of the market and some modern theorist presents it as self-organization.


The logic of things stands outside of us (in the hands of God or natural or spontaneous forces);


When I was in business school I rarely attended lectures in something called strategic planning, a required course, and when I showed my face in class, I did not listen for a nanosecond to what was said there; did not even buy the books. There is something about the common sense of student culture; we knew that it was all babble.

Almost everything theoretical in management, from Taylorism to all productivity stories, upon empirical testing, has been exposed as pseudoscience—and like most economic theories, lives in a world parallel to the evidence.


For an illustration of business drift, rational and opportunistic business drift, take the following. Coca-Cola began as a pharmaceutical product. Tiffany & Co., the fancy jewelry store company, started life as a stationery store. The last two examples are close, perhaps, but consider next: Raytheon, which made the first missile guidance system, was a refrigerator maker (one of the founders was no other than Vannevar Bush, who conceived the teleological linear model of science we saw earlier; go figure). Now, worse: Nokia, who used to be the top mobile phone maker, began as a paper mill (at some stage they were into rubber shoes).

DuPont, now famous for Teflon nonstick cooking pans, Corian countertops, and the durable fabric Kevlar, actually started out as an explosives company. Avon, the cosmetics company, started out in door-to-door book sales. And, the strangest of all, Oneida Silversmiths was a community religious cult but for regulatory reasons they needed to use as cover a joint stock company.


To repeat (it is necessary to repeat because intellectuals tends to forget it), evidence of absence is not absence of evidence,


For out of the hundred or so million Mexicans, Slim would (I estimate) be richer than the bottom seventy to ninety million all taken together. So you may sample fifty million persons and unless you include that “rare event,” you may have nothing in your sample and underestimate the total wealth.


We will return to these two distinct payoffs, with “bounded left” (limited losses, like Thales’ bet) and “bounded right” (limited gains, like insurance or banking). The distinction is crucial, as most payoffs in life fall in either one or the other category.


(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs; (iii) Do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. It is simply more robust to do so; (iv) Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.


Formal thinkers and theorizing theorizers tend to write books; seat-of-the-pants people tend to be practitioners who are often content to get the excitement, make or lose the money, and discourse at the pub.


Formal thinkers and theorizing theorizers tend to write books; seat-of-the-pants people tend to be practitioners who are often content to get the excitement, make or lose the money, and discourse at the pub. Their experiences are often formalized by academics; indeed, history has been written by those who want you to believe that reasoning has a monopoly or near monopoly on the production of knowledge.


Medicine, for the Arabs, was a scholarly pursuit and founded on the logic of Aristotle and the methods of Galen; they abhorred experience.6 Medical practitioners were the Other.


“Charlatan” was held to be a synonym for empirick. The word “empiric” designated someone who relied on experiment and experience to ascertain what was correct. In other words, trial and error and tinkering. That was held to be inferior—professionally, socially, and intellectually. It is still not considered to be very “intelligent.” But luckily for us, the empirics enjoyed immense popular support and could not be uprooted. You do not see their works,


The fight between the “legitimate” doctors and the Others is quite enlightening, particularly when you note that doctors were silently (and reluctantly) copying some of the remedies and cures developed and promoted by the Others.


Johan Jensen, of Jensen’s inequality, which provides the major technical support behind the ideas of this book, was an amateur mathematician who never held any academic position.


If you want to understand how vapid are the current modernistic arguments (and understand your existential priorities), consider the difference between lions in the wild and those in captivity. Lions in captivity live longer; they are technically richer, and they are guaranteed job security for life, if these are the criteria you are focusing on …


As usual, an ancient, here Seneca, detected the problem (and the difference) with his saying “We do not study for life, but only for the lecture room,” non vitae, sed scolae discimus,


Although I was not yet familiar with gyms, my idea of knowledge was as follows. People who build their strength using these modern expensive gym machines can lift extremely large weights, show great numbers and develop impressive-looking muscles, but fail to lift a stone; they get completely hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn’t exist outside of ludic—extremely organized—constructs. In fact their strength, as with overspecialized athletes, is the result of a deformity. I thought it was the same with people who were selected for trying to get high grades in a small number of subjects rather than follow their curiosity: try taking them slightly away from what they studied and watch their decomposition, loss of confidence, and denial.


Avoidance of boredom is the only worthy mode of action. Life otherwise is not worth living.)


“much of what other people know isn’t worth knowing.”


Indeed, the most severe mistake made in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent—something Nietzsche figured out. In a way, it resembles the turkey problem, mistaking what we don’t see for the nonexistent, a sibling to mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence.


Fat Tony’s power in life is that he never lets the other person frame the question. He taught Nero that an answer is planted in every question; never respond with a straight answer to a question that makes no sense to you.


Perhaps—thus he [Socrates] should have asked himself—what is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent? Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled?


We practitioners and quants aren’t too fazed by remarks on the part of academics—it would be like prostitutes listening to technical commentary by nuns.


For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock.


For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).


For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point). A simple case—known heuristically by weight lifters. In the bodyguard-emulating story in Chapter 2, I focused only on the maximum I could do. Lifting one hundred pounds once brings more benefits than lifting fifty pounds twice, and certainly a lot more than lifting one pound a hundred times.


As with the idea of having elephants as pets, squeezes are much, much more expensive (relative to size) for large corporations. The gains from size are visible but the risks are hidden, and some concealed risks seem to bring frailties into the companies.


Wealth means more, and because of nonlinear scaling, more is different. We are prone to make more severe errors because we are simply wealthier. Just as projects of one hundred million dollars are more unpredictable and more likely to incur overruns than five-million-dollar ones, simply by being richer, the world is troubled with additional unpredictability and fragility.

charlatans are recognizable in that they will give you positive advice, and only positive advice, exploiting our gullibility and sucker-proneness for recipes that hit you in a flash as just obvious, then evaporate later as you forget them. Just look at the “how to” books with, in their title, “Ten Steps for—” (fill in: enrichment, weight loss, making friends, innovation, getting elected, building muscles, finding a husband, running an orphanage, etc.). Yet in practice it is the negative that’s used by the pros, those selected by evolution: chess grandmasters usually win by not losing; people become rich by not going bust (particularly when others do); religions are mostly about interdicts; the learning of life is about what to avoid. You reduce most of your personal risks of accident thanks to a small number of measures.


one cannot really tell if a successful person has skills, or if a person with skills will succeed—but we can pretty much predict the negative, that a person totally devoid of skills will eventually fail.


So knowledge grows by subtraction much more than by addition—given that what we know today might turn out to be wrong but what we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right, at least not easily. If I spot a black swan (not capitalized), I can be quite certain that the statement “all swans are white” is wrong. But even if I have never seen a black swan, I can never hold such a statement to be true.

Rephrasing it again: since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it, disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation.


For the Arab scholar and religious leader Ali Bin Abi-Taleb (no relation), keeping one’s distance from an ignorant person is equivalent to keeping company with a wise man. Finally, consider this modernized version in a saying from Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.

Antifragility implies—contrary to initial instinct—that the old is superior to the new, and much more than you think. No matter how something looks to your intellectual machinery, or how well or poorly it narrates, time will know more about its fragilities and break it when necessary.


“Time has sharp teeth that destroy everything,” declaimed the sixth-century (B.C.) poet Simonides of Ceos,


This treadmill effect has been investigated by Danny Kahneman and his peers when they studied the psychology of what they call hedonic states. People acquire a new item, feel more satisfied after an initial boost, then rapidly revert to their baseline of well-being. So, when you “upgrade,” you feel a boost of satisfaction with changes in technology. But then you get used to it and start hunting for the new new thing.

Even the conversation of a high school teacher or that of an unsuccessful college professor is likely to be more worthwhile than the latest academic paper, less corrupted with neomania. My best conversations in philosophy have been with French lycée teachers who love the topic but are not interested in pursuing a career writing papers in it (in France they teach philosophy in the last year of high school).

Of course you may be lucky enough to hit on a jewel here and there, but in general, at best, conversation with an academic would be like the conversation of plumbers, at the worst that of a concierge bandying the worst brand of gossip: gossip about uninteresting people (other academics), small talk. True, the conversation of top scientists can sometimes be captivating, those people who aggregate knowledge and for whom cruising the subject is effortless as the entire small parts of the field come glued together. But these people are just currently too rare on this planet.

Add neurosomething to a field, and suddenly it rises in respectability and becomes more convincing as people now have the illusion of a strong causal link—yet the brain is too complex for that; it is both the most complex part of the human anatomy and the one that seems most susceptible to sucker-causation.


Montaigne, mostly a synthesizer of classical writers, has his Essays replete with anecdotes: A Lacedaemonian was asked what had made him live so long; he answered, “Ignoring medicine.” Montaigne also detected the agency problem, or why the last thing a doctor needs is for you to be healthy: “No doctor derives pleasure from the health of his friends, wrote the ancient Greek satirist, no soldier from the peace of his city, etc.” (Nul médecin ne prent plaisir à la santé de ses amis mesmes, dit l’ancien Comique Grec, ny soldat à la paix de sa ville: ainsi du reste.)

life expectancy at birth used to be thirty until the last century, that people lived just thirty years. The distribution was massively skewed, with the bulk of the deaths coming from birth and childhood mortality. Conditional life expectancy was high—just consider that ancestral men tended to die of trauma.1 Perhaps legal enforcement contributed more than doctors to the increase in length of life—so the gains in life expectancy are more societal than from the result of scientific advance.

The robustness—even antifragility—of society depends on them; if we are here today, it is because someone, at some stage, took some risks for us. But courage and heroism do not mean blind risk taking—it is not necessarily recklessness.

Hammurabi’s code—now about 3,800 years old—identifies the need to reestablish a symmetry of fragility, spelled out as follows: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house—the builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of the son of the owner of the house, a son of that builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of a slave of the owner of the house—he shall give to the owner of the house a slave of equal value.


The problem is that society is currently doing the exact opposite, granting mere talkers a free option.

## Cosmos, Carl Sagan


If we lived on a planet where nothing ever changed, there would be little to do. There would be nothing to figure out. There would be no impetus for science. And if we lived in an unpredictable world, where things changed in random or very complex ways, we would not be able to figure things out. Again, there would be no such thing as science. But we live in an in-between universe, where things change, but according to patterns, rules, or, as we call them, laws of nature. If I throw a stick up in the air, it always falls down. If the sun sets in the west, it always rises again the next morning in the east. And so it becomes possible to figure things out.

Kepler’s third or harmonic law, a precise connection between the size of a planet’s orbit and the period for it to go once around the Sun. It clearly applies to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, planets discovered long after Kepler’s death.


“Astronomy,” he said, “is part of physics.” Kepler stood at a cusp in history; the last scientific astrologer was the first astrophysicist.


Kepler assessed his discoveries in these words: With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist … I yield freely to the sacred frenzy … the die is cast, and I am writing the book—to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not.

His epitaph, which he himself composed, was: “I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure. Sky-bound was the mind, Earth-bound the body rests.”


Newton was born on Christmas Day, 1642, so tiny that, as his mother told him years later, he would have fit into a quart mug. Sickly, feeling abandoned by his parents, quarrelsome, unsociable, a virgin to the day he died, Isaac Newton was perhaps the greatest scientific genius who ever lived.


At the Stourbridge Fair in 1663, at age twenty, he purchased a book on astrology, “out of a curiosity to see what there was in it.” He read it until he came to an illustration which he could not understand, because he was ignorant of trigonometry. So he purchased a book on trigonometry but soon found himself unable to follow the geometrical arguments. So he found a copy of Euclid’s Elements of Geometry, and began to read. Two years later he invented the differential calculus.


Newton, in his mid-forties, was described by his servant as follows: I never knew him to take any recreation or pastime either in riding out to take the air, walking, bowling, or any other exercise whatever, thinking all hours lost that were not spent in his studies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his chamber unless [to lecture] at term time … where so few went to hear him, and fewer understood him, that ofttimes he did in a manner, for want of hearers, read to the walls.


gravity must decrease with distance, which is why a comet or a planet moves slowly when far from the Sun and faster when close to the Sun—the gravity it feels is weaker the farther from the Sun it is.


time. Bernoulli originally specified a deadline of six months, but extended it to a year and a half at the request of Leibniz, one of the leading scholars of the time, and the man who had, independently of Newton, invented the differential and integral calculus. The challenge was delivered to Newton at four P.M. on January 29, 1697. Before leaving for work the next morning, he had invented an entire new branch of mathematics called the calculus of variations, used it to solve the brachistochrone problem and sent off the solution, which was published, at Newton’s request, anonymously.

Just before his death he wrote: “I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the seashore, and diverting myself, in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”

Notes: 1) Newton  


In the early morning hours of June 30, 1908, in Central Siberia, a giant fireball was seen moving rapidly across the sky. Where it touched the horizon, an enormous explosion took place. It leveled some 2,000 square kilometers of forest and burned thousands of trees in a flash fire near the impact site. It produced an atmospheric shock wave that twice circled the Earth. For two days afterward, there was so much fine dust in the atmosphere that one could read a newspaper at night by scattered light in the streets of London, 10,000 kilometers away.

the early history of the solar system, there were probably many planets in the process of formation. Those with elliptical crossing orbits tended to collide and destroy themselves. Those with circular orbits tended to grow and survive. The orbits of the present planets are the orbits of the survivors of this collisional natural selection, the stable middle age of a solar system dominated by early catastrophic impacts.


Venus turns once every 243 Earth days, but backwards, in the opposite direction from all other planets in the inner solar system. As a result, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, taking 118 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise. What is more, it presents almost exactly the same face to the Earth each time it is closest to our planet.


It keeps the oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus, the Earth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it resides in the crust as limestone and other carbonates, not in the atmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a little closer to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would drive some of the CO2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turn incrementally heat the surface further.

Fine sand grains, all more or less uniform in size, have been produced from larger rocks through ages of jostling and rubbing, abrasion and erosion, again driven through waves and weather by the distant Moon and Sun. The beach also reminds us of time. The world is much older than the human species.


All places on Earth are, to high precision, the same distance from any star. This is why the star patterns in a given constellation do not change as we go from, say, Soviet Central Asia to the American Midwest.


Milton Humason


As the light leaves these stars, certain frequencies or colors are absorbed by the atoms in the stars’ outermost layers. The resulting lines permit us to tell that stars millions of light-years away contain the same chemical elements as our Sun and the nearby stars. Humason and Hubble found, to their amazement, that the spectra of all the distant galaxies are red-shifted and, still more startling, that the more distant the galaxy was, the more red-shifted were its spectral lines. The most obvious explanation of the red shift was in terms of the Doppler effect: the galaxies were receding from us; the more distant the galaxy the greater its speed of recession.


light leaving an intense gravitational field has to do so much work to escape that it loses energy during the journey, the process perceived by a distant observer as a shift of the escaping light to longer wavelengths and redder colors.


A typical whale song lasts for perhaps fifteen minutes; the longest, about an hour. Often it is repeated, identically, beat for beat, measure for measure, note for note. Occasionally a group of whales will leave their winter waters in the midst of a song and six months later return to continue at precisely the right note, as if there had been no interruption. Whales are very good at remembering


Very often the members of the group will sing the same song together. By some mutual consensus, some collaborative song-writing, the piece changes month by month, slowly and predictably. These vocalizations are complex. If the songs of the humpback whale are enunciated as a tonal language, the total information content, the number of bits of information in such songs, is some 106 bits, about the same as the information content of the Illiad or the Odyssey. We

The American biologist Roger Payne has calculated that using the deep ocean sound channel, two whales could communicate with each other at twenty Hertz essentially anywhere in the world. One might be off the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica and communicate with another in the Aleutians. For most of their history, the whales may have established a global communications network


Even in sleep, the brain is pulsing, throbbing and flashing with the complex business of human life—dreaming, remembering, figuring things out. Our thoughts, visions and fantasies have a physical reality. A thought is made of hundreds of electrochemical impulses.


Most of the world’s great cities have grown haphazardly, little by little, in response to the needs of the moment; very rarely is a city planned for the remote future. The evolution of a city is like the evolution of the brain: it develops from a small center and slowly grows and changes, leaving many old parts still functioning. There is no way for evolution to rip out the ancient interior of the brain because of its imperfections and replace it with something of more modern manufacture.

thousands of years, writing was chiseled into clay and stone, scratched onto wax or bark or leather; painted on bamboo or papyrus or silk—but always one copy at a time and, except for the inscriptions on monuments, always for a tiny readership. Then in China between the second and sixth centuries, paper, ink and printing with carved wooden blocks were all invented, permitting many copies of a work to be made and distributed. It took a thousand years for the idea to catch on in remote and backward Europe. Then, suddenly, books were being printed all over the world. Just before the invention of movable type, around 1450, there were no more than a few tens of thousands of books in all of Europe, all handwritten; about as many as in China in 100 B.C., and a tenth as many as in the Great Library of Alexandria. Fifty years later, around 1500, there were ten million printed books. Learning had become available to anyone who could read. Magic was everywhere.


The farther back the critical events occur, the more powerfully can they influence the present.

the reply. The boy’s name was Jean François Champollion. Fired by the mystery of the language no one could read, he became a superb linguist and passionately immersed himself in ancient Egyptian writing. France at that time was flooded with Egyptian artifacts, stolen by Napoleon and later made available to Western scholars. The description of the expedition was published, and devoured by the young Champollion. As an adult, Champollion succeeded; fulfilling his childhood ambition, he provided a brilliant decipherment of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. But it was not until 1828, twenty-seven years after his meeting with Fourier, that Champollion first set foot in Egypt, the land of his dreams, and sailed upstream from Cairo, following the course of the Nile, paying homage to the culture he had worked so hard to understand. It was an expedition in time, a visit to an alien civilization: The evening of the 16th we finally arrived at Dendera.

“Superstition [is] cowardice in the face of the Divine,” wrote Theophrastus, who lived during the founding of the Library of Alexandria.


There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool.


Only once before in our history was there the promise of a brilliant scientific civilization. Beneficiary of the Ionian Awakening, it had its citadel at the Library of Alexandria, where 2,000 years ago the best minds of antiquity established the foundations for the systematic study of mathematics, physics, biology, astronomy, literature, geography and medicine. We build on those foundations still. The Library was constructed and supported by the Ptolemys, the Greek kings who inherited the Egyptian portion of the empire of Alexander the Great. From the time of its creation in the third century B.C. until its destruction seven centuries later, it was the brain and heart of the ancient world. Alexandria was the publishing


The Ptolemys did not merely collect established knowledge; they encouraged and financed scientific research and so generated new knowledge. The results were amazing: Eratosthenes accurately calculated the size of the Earth, mapped it, and argued that India could be reached by sailing westward from Spain. Hipparchus anticipated that stars come into being, slowly move during the course of centuries, and eventually perish; it was he who first catalogued the positions and magnitudes of the stars to detect such changes. Euclid produced a textbook on geometry from which humans learned for twenty-three centuries, a work that was to help awaken the scientific interest of Kepler, Newton and Einstein. Galen wrote basic works on healing and anatomy which dominated medicine until the Renaissance. There were, as we have noted, many others. Alexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. People of all nations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On


there is no record, in the entire history of the Library, that any of its illustrious scientists and scholars ever seriously challenged the political, economic and religious assumptions of their society. The permanence of the stars was questioned; the justice of slavery was not. Science and learning in general were the preserve of a privileged few. The vast population of the city had not the vaguest notion of the great discoveries taking place within the Library. New findings were not explained or popularized. The research benefited them little. Discoveries in mechanics and steam technology were applied mainly to the perfection of weapons, the encouragement of superstition, the amusement of kings. The scientists never grasped the potential of machines to free people.* The great intellectual achievements of antiquity had few immediate practical applications. Science never captured the imagination of the multitude. There was no counterbalance to stagnation, to pessimism, to the most abject surrenders to mysticism. When, at long last, the mob came to burn the Library down, there was nobody to stop them.


Our achievements rest on the accomplishments of 40,000 generations of our human predecessors, all but a tiny fraction of whom are nameless and forgotten.


And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.


The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars.

## Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse


they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he alone among hundreds of thousands. This is what I have thought and realized, when I have heard the teachings. This is why I am continuing my travels—not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die.

Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons.

He was open to everything,

he also saw the river going downhill, always moving on downhill, and singing and being happy through it all. He liked this well, kindly he smiled at the river.

‘How vain painting is, exciting admiration by its resemblance to things of which we do not admire the originals' (Pensées, 40).


‘No changing of place at a hundred miles an hour will make us one whit stronger, happier, or wiser. There was always more in the world than men could see, walked they ever so slowly; they will see it no better for going fast. The really precious things are thought and sight, not pace. It does a bullet no good to go fast; and a man, if he be truly a man, no harm to go slow; for his glory is not at all in going, but in being.'


It is a measure of how accustomed we are to inattention that we would be thought unusual and perhaps dangerous if we stopped and stared at a place for as long as a sketcher would require to draw it. Ten minutes of acute concentration at least are needed to draw a tree, but even the prettiest tree rarely detains passersby for longer than a minute.

‘It is a strange thing how little people know about the sky. We never attend to it, we never make it a subject of thought, we look upon it only as a succession of meaningless and monotonous accidents, too common and too vain to be worthy of a moment of watchfulness or a glance of admiration. If in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity, we turn to the sky as a last resource, which of its phenomena do we speak of? One says it has been wet, and another, it has been windy, and another, it has been warm. Who, among the whole chattering crowd, can tell me of the forms and the precipices of the chain of tall white mountains that girded the horizon at noon today? Who saw the narrow sunbeam that came out of the south, and smote upon their summits until they melted and mouldered away in a dust of blue rain? Who saw the dance of the dead clouds when the sunlight left them last night, and the west wind blew them before it like withered leaves?'


‘The sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his room'—Pascal, Pensées, 136.


When we observe how some people know how to manage their experiences—their insignificant, everyday experiences—so that they become an arable soil that bears fruit three times a year, while others—and how many there are!—are driven through surging waves of destiny, the most multifarious currents of the times and the nations, and yet always remain on top, bobbing like a cork, then we are in the end tempted to divide mankind into a minority (a minimality) of those who know how to make much of little, and a majority of those who know how to make little of much.

It is said by the masters that even a little poison can cause death and even a tiny seed can become a huge tree. And as Buddha said: “Do not overlook negative actions merely because they are small; however small a spark may be, it can burn down a haystack as big as a mountain.” Similarly he said: “Do not overlook tiny good actions, thinking they are of no benefit; even tiny drops of water in the end will fill a huge vessel.” 


With constant repetition our inclinations and habits become steadily more entrenched, and go on continuing, increasing, and gathering power, even when we sleep. This is how they come to determine our life, our death, and our rebirth. 


“How will I be when I die?” The answer to that is that whatever state of mind we are in now, whatever kind of person we are now: that’s what we will be like at the moment of death, if we do not change. This is why it is so absolutely important to use this lifetime to purify our mindstream, and so our basic being and character, while we can.

The other interesting thing about that ten thousand hours, of course, is that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a young adult. You have to have parents who encourage and support you. You can’t be poor, because if you have to hold down a part-time job on the side to help make ends meet, there won’t be time left in the day to practice enough. In fact, most people can reach that number only if they get into some kind of special program — like a hockey all-star squad — or if they get some kind of extraordinary opportunity that gives them a chance to put in those hours.

## Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data, Charles Wheelan


The Gini index measures how evenly wealth (or income) is shared within a country on a scale from zero to one. The statistic can be calculated for wealth or for annual income, and it can be calculated at the individual level or at the household level. (All of these statistics will be highly correlated but not identical.) The Gini index, like the passer rating, has no intrinsic meaning; it’s a tool for comparison. A country in which every household had identical wealth would have a Gini index of zero. By contrast, a country in which a single household held the country’s entire wealth would have a Gini index of one.


relationship is causal, meaning that a change in one variable is really causing a change in the other.


The first descriptive task is often to find some measure of the “middle” of a set of data, or what statisticians


The first descriptive task is often to find some measure of the “middle” of a set of data, or what statisticians might describe as its “central tendency.”


The most basic measure of the “middle” of a distribution is the mean, or average.


The mean, or average, turns out to have some problems in that regard, namely, that it is prone to distortion by “outliers,” which are observations


The mean, or average, turns out to have some problems in that regard, namely, that it is prone to distortion by “outliers,” which are observations that lie farther from the center.


For distributions without serious outliers, the median and the mean will be similar.


the median divides a distribution in half. The distribution can be further divided into quarters, or quartiles. The first quartile consists of the bottom 25 percent of the observations; the second quartile consists of the next 25 percent of the observations; and so on. Or the distribution can be divided into deciles, each with 10 percent of the observations. (If your income is in the top decile of the American income distribution, you would be earning more than 90 percent of your fellow workers.) We can go even further and divide the distribution into hundredths, or percentiles. Each percentile represents 1 percent of the distribution, so that the 1st percentile represents the bottom 1 percent of the distribution and the 99th percentile represents the top 1 percent of the distribution.


standard deviation, which is a measure of how dispersed the data are from their mean.


The standard deviation is the descriptive statistic that allows us to assign a single number to this dispersion around the mean.


high proportion


far fewer observations lie two standard deviations from the mean, and fewer still lie three or four standard deviations away.


Assume that a department store is selling a dress for $100. The assistant manager marks down all merchandise by 25 percent. But then that assistant manager is fired for hanging out in a bar with Bill Gates,* and the new assistant manager raises all prices by 25 percent. What is the final price of the dress? If you said (or thought) $100, then you had better not skip any paragraphs. The final price of the dress is actually $93.75.


A wage is what we are paid for some fixed amount of labor, such as an hourly or weekly wage. Income is the sum of all payments from different sources.

Percentages don’t lie—but they can exaggerate. One way to make growth look explosive is to use percentage change to describe some change relative to a very low starting point.


A correlation of 1, often described as perfect correlation, means that every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the same direction.


The formula for calculating the correlation coefficient does the following: 1. Calculates the mean and standard deviation for both variables.


Converts all the data so that each observation is represented by its distance (in standard deviations) from the mean.


The formula then calculates the relationship between height and weight across all the individuals in the sample as measured by standard units.


correlation does not imply causation; a positive or negative association between two variables does not necessarily mean that a change in one of the variables is causing the change in the other.


APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 4 To calculate the correlation coefficient between two sets of numbers, you would perform the following steps, each of which is illustrated by use of the data on heights and weights for 15 hypothetical students in the table below. 1. Convert the height of each student to standard units: (height – mean)/standard deviation. 2. Convert the weight of each student to standard units: (weight – mean)/standard deviation. 3. Calculate the product for each student of (weight in standard units) × (height in standard units). You should see that this number will be largest in absolute value when a student’s height and weight are both relatively far from the mean. 4. The correlation coefficient is the sum of the products calculated above divided by the number of observations (15 in this case).


(More than 99 percent of all DNA is identical among all humans.)


probability of Event A happening and Event B happening is the probability of Event A multiplied by the probability of Event B.


Suppose you are interested in the probability that one event happens or another event happens: outcome A or outcome B (again assuming that they are independent). In this case, the probability of getting A or B consists of the sum of their individual probabilities: the probability of A plus the probability of B.

Very little attention was devoted to the “tail risk,” the small risk (named for the tail of the distribution) of some catastrophic outcome.


The VaR models were just like my golf range finder when it was set to meters instead of yards: exact and wrong. The


if you flip a fair coin 1,000,000 times and get 1,000,000 heads in a row, the probability of getting tails on the next flip is still ½.


Here is an exercise that I do with my students to make the same basic point. The larger the class, the better it works. I ask everyone in the class to take out a coin and stand up. We all flip the coin; anyone who flips heads must sit down. Assuming we start with 100 students, roughly 50 will sit down after the first flip. Then we do it again, after which 25 or so are still standing. And so on. More often than not, there will be a student standing at the end who has flipped five or six tails in a row. At that point, I ask the student questions like “How did you do it?” and “What are the best training exercises for flipping so many tails in a row?” or “Is there a special diet that helped you pull off this impressive accomplishment?”

Notes: 1) An anomalous event occured with theperson standing till last. 


reversion to the mean. Probability tells us that any outlier—an observation that is particularly far from the mean in one direction or the other—is likely to be followed by outcomes that are more consistent with the long-term average.


One way to think about this mean reversion is that performance—both mental and physical—consists of some underlying talent-related effort plus an element of luck, good or bad. (Statisticians would call this random error.)


Malmendier and Tate write, “Our results suggest that media-induced superstar culture leads to behavioral distortions beyond mere mean reversion.”


The broader point here is that our ability to analyze data has grown far more sophisticated than our thinking about what we ought to do with the results.

cyanobacteria. (These bacteria are blue, and they are the only kind of bacteria that get their energy from photosynthesis; hence the original description of the disease as “blue-green algae.”)


As polls with good samples get larger, they get better, since the margin of error shrinks. As polls with bad samples get larger, the pile of garbage just gets bigger and smellier.


Recall bias is one reason that longitudinal studies are often preferred to cross-sectional studies. In a longitudinal study the data are collected contemporaneously. At age five, a participant can be asked about his attitudes toward school. Then, thirteen years later, we can revisit that same participant and determine whether he has dropped out of high school. In a cross-sectional study, in which all the data are collected at one point in time, we must ask an eighteen-year-old high school dropout how he or she felt about school at age five, which is inherently less reliable.


(If you have a room of people with varying heights, forcing the short people to leave will raise the average height in the room, but it doesn’t make anyone taller.)


The core principle underlying the central limit theorem is that a large, properly drawn sample will resemble the population from which it is drawn.


The central limit theorem tells us that the sample means will be distributed roughly as a normal distribution around the population mean. The

The standard error measures the dispersion of the sample means. How tightly do we expect the sample


The standard error measures the dispersion of the sample means. How tightly do we expect the sample means to cluster around the population mean? There is some potential confusion here, as we have now introduced two different measures of dispersion: the standard deviation and the standard error. Here is what you need to remember to keep them straight: 1. The standard deviation measures dispersion in the underlying population. In this case, it might measure the dispersion of the weights of all the participants in the Framingham Heart Study, or the dispersion around the mean for the entire marathon field. 2. The standard error measures the dispersion of the sample means. If we draw repeated samples of 100 participants from the Framingham Heart Study, what will the dispersion of those sample means look like? 3. Here is what ties the two concepts together: The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample means!

SE where s is the standard deviation of the population from which the sample is drawn, and n is the size of the sample.


Because the sample means are distributed normally (thanks to the central limit theorem), we can harness the power of the normal curve. We expect that roughly 68 percent of all sample means will lie within one standard error of the population mean; 95 percent of the sample means will lie within two standard errors of the population mean; and 99.7 percent of the sample means will lie within three standard errors of the population mean.


To be more precise, any statistical inference begins with an implicit or explicit null hypothesis. This is our starting assumption, which will be rejected or not on the basis of subsequent statistical analysis. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we typically accept some alternative hypothesis that is more consistent with the data observed. For example, in a court of law the starting assumption, or null hypothesis, is that the defendant is innocent. The job of the prosecution is to persuade the judge or jury to reject that assumption and


It may seem counterintuitive, but researchers often create a null hypothesis in hopes of being able to reject it.


One of the most common thresholds that researchers use for rejecting a null hypothesis is 5 percent, which is often written in decimal form: .05. This probability is known as a significance level, and it represents the upper bound for the likelihood of observing some pattern of data if the null hypothesis were true.

Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and punishment been insinuated—and now even into the basis of your souls, ye virtuous ones! 


Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: "What I am NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!" 


And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they tick, and want people to call ticking—virtue. 


And when they say: "I am just," it always soundeth like: "I am just—revenged!" With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies; and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others. 


And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a sort of attitude. Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue, but their heart knoweth naught thereof. 


Ah! my friends! That YOUR very Self be in your action, as the mother is in the child: let that be YOUR formula of virtue!

## History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics), Bertrand Russell


All definite knowledge—so I should contend—belongs to science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to theology. But between theology and science there is a No Man's Land, exposed to attack from both sides; this No Man's Land is philosophy. Almost all the questions of most interest to speculative minds are such as science cannot answer, and the confident answers of theologians no longer seem so convincing as they did in former centuries.


the circumstances of men's lives do much to determine their philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances.


Science tells us what we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe. Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting fairy tales.


To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralysed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.


education was almost wholly confined to the clergy. The explicit philosophy of the Middle Ages is not an accurate mirror of the times, but only of what was thought by one party.


What had happened in the great age of Greece happened again in Renaissance Italy: traditional moral restraints disappeared, because they were seen to be associated with superstition; the liberation from fetters made individuals energetic and creative, producing a rare florescence of genius; but the anarchy and treachery which inevitably resulted from the decay of morals made Italians collectively impotent, and they fell, like the Greeks, under the domination of nations less civilized than themselves but not so destitute of social cohesion.


In general, important civilizations start with a rigid and superstitious system, gradually relaxed, and leading, at a certain stage, to a period of brilliant genius, while the good of the old tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet developed. But as the evil unfolds, it leads to anarchy, thence, inevitably, to a new tyranny, producing a new synthesis secured by a new system of dogma.

After receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour across Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart: ‘It has to be boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it for you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur’s cap. That’d give us both a bit of variety.’ Planck liked the idea, so that evening the driver held a long lecture on quantum mechanics in front of a distinguished audience. Later, a physics professor stood up with a question. The driver recoiled: ‘Never would I have thought that someone from such an advanced city as Munich would ask such a simple question! My chauffeur will answer it.’ According to Charlie Munger, one of the world’s best investors (and from whom I have borrowed this story), there are two types of knowledge. First, we have real knowledge. We see it in people who have committed a large amount of time and effort to understanding a topic. The second type is chauffeur knowledge – knowledge from people who have learned to put on a show. Maybe they have a great voice or good hair, but the knowledge they espouse is not their own. They reel off eloquent words as if reading from a script.


According to Charlie Munger, one of the world’s best investors (and from whom I have borrowed this story), there are two types of knowledge. First, we have real knowledge. We see it in people who have committed a large amount of time and effort to understanding a topic. The second type is chauffeur knowledge – knowledge from people who have learned to put on a show. Maybe they have a great voice or good hair, but the knowledge they espouse is not their own. They reel off eloquent words as if reading from a script.


To guard against the chauffeur effect, Warren Buffett, Munger’s business partner, has coined a wonderful phrase, ‘circle of competence’. What lies inside this circle you understand intuitively; what lies outside, you may only partially comprehend. One of Munger’s best pieces of advice is: ‘You have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don’t understand. It’s not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is.’

According to research, we see people as pleasant if A) they are outwardly attractive, B) they are similar to us in terms of origin, personality or interests, and C) they like us.


So, if you are a salesperson, make buyers think you like them, even if this means outright flattery. And if you are a consumer, always judge a product independent of who is selling it. Banish the salespeople from your mind, or rather, pretend you don’t like them.

don’t cling to things. Consider your property something that the ‘universe’ (whatever you believe this to be) has bestowed on you temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this (or more) in the blink of an eye.


In psychology, this phenomenon is called reactance: when we are deprived of an option, we suddenly deem it more attractive


In fact, it has been proven that, emotionally, a loss ‘weighs’ about twice that of a similar gain. Social scientists call this loss aversion. For this reason, if you want to convince someone about something, don’t focus on the advantages; instead highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages.


Evolution has led us to develop many fine-tuned senses, including how much idleness we can get away with and how to recognise it in others.

action bias: look active, even if it achieves nothing.


Although we now value contemplation more highly, outright inaction remains a cardinal sin. You get no honour, no medal, no statue with your name on it if you make exactly the right decision by waiting – for the good of the company, the state, even humanity. On the other hand, if you demonstrate decisiveness and quick judgement, and the situation improves (though perhaps coincidentally), it’s quite possible your boss, or even the mayor, will shake your hand. Society at large still prefers rash action to a sensible wait-and-see strategy.

The river can be very shallow – mere inches – for long stretches, but it might transform into a raging torrent that is twenty feet deep in the middle, in which case you could easily drown.

In his short story ‘Del rigor en la ciencia’, which consists of just a single paragraph, Jorge Luis Borges describes a special country. In this country, the science of cartography is so sophisticated that only the most detailed of maps will do – that is, a map with a scale of 1:1, as large as the country itself. Its citizens soon realise that such a map does not provide any insight, since it merely duplicates what they already know. Borges’ map is an extreme case of the information bias, the delusion that more information guarantees better decisions. Searching for a hotel in Miami a little

All we know is that expectations alter the biochemistry of the brain and thus the whole body. Accordingly Alzheimer’s patients cannot benefit from it: their condition impairs the area of the brain that deals with expectations. Expectations are intangible, but their effect is quite real. They have the power to change reality. Can we deprogramme them? Is it possible to live a life free from expectations? Unfortunately not.


If you like something, you believe that the risks are smaller and the benefits greater than they actually are. If you don’t like something, the opposite is true. Risks and benefits appear to be dependent. Of course, in reality, they are not.


But how pure and honest is internal reflection? The Swedish psychologist Petter Johannson allowed test subjects to glimpse two portrait photos of random people and choose which face was more attractive. Then he showed them the preferred photo up close and asked them to describe the most attractive features. However, with a sleight of hand, he switched the pictures. Most participants failed to notice and proceeded to justify, in detail, why they favoured the image. The results of the study: introspection is not reliable. When we soul-search, we contrive the findings.


In the third century B.C., General Xiang Yu sent his army across the Yangtze River to take on the Qin Dynasty. While his troops slept, he ordered all the ships to be set alight. The next day he told them: ‘You now have a choice: Either you fight to win or you die.’ By removing the option of retreat, he switched their focus to the only thing that mattered: the battle.


CEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the end. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing no one. Salespeople who chase every single lead close no deals.

However, this can easily destroy success. We must learn to close doors.


a life strategy similar to a corporate strategy: write down what not to pursue in your life. In other words, make calculated decisions to disregard certain possibilities and when an option shows up, test it against your not-to-pursue list. It will not only keep you from trouble but also save you lots of thinking time. Think hard once and then just consult your list instead of having to make up your mind whenever a new door cracks open. Most doors are not worth going through, even when the handle seems to turn so effortlessly.

How can you thwart the sleeper effect? First, don’t accept any unsolicited advice, even if it seems well meant. Doing so, you protect yourself to a certain degree from manipulation. Second, avoid ad-contaminated sources like the plague. How fortunate we are that books are (still) ad-free! Third, try to remember the source of every argument you encounter. Whose opinions are these? And why do they think that way? Probe the issue like an investigator would: cui bono? Who benefits? Admittedly, this is a lot of work and will slow down your decision-making. But it will also refine it.

The Black Swan


‘All swans are white.’ For centuries, this statement was watertight. Every snowy specimen corroborated this. A swan in a different colour? Unthinkable. That was until the year 1697, when Willem de Vlamingh saw a black swan for the first time during an expedition to Australia. Since then, black swans have become symbols of the improbable.


Mathematics professor Barry Mazur tells this story: ‘Some years ago I was trying to decide whether or not I should move from Stanford to Harvard. I had bored my friends silly with endless discussion. Finally, one of them said, “You’re one of our leading decision theorists. Maybe you should make a list of the costs and benefits and try to roughly calculate your expected utility.” Without thinking, I blurted out, “Come on, Sandy, this is serious.”’


is safe to assume that half of what you remember is wrong. Our memories are riddled with inaccuracies, including the seemingly flawless flashbulb memories.


Two boxes. Box A contains 100 balls: 50 red and 50 black. Box B also holds 100 balls, but you don’t know how many are red and how many black. If you reach into one of the boxes without looking and draw out a red ball, you win $100. Which box will you choose: A or B? The majority will opt for A. Let’s play again, using exactly the same boxes. This time, you win $100 if you draw out a black ball. Which box will you go for now? Most likely you’ll choose A again. But that’s illogical! In the first round, you assumed that B contained fewer red balls (and more black balls), so, rationally, you would have to opt for B this time around.


The Ellsberg Paradox offers empirical proof that we favour known probabilities (box A) over unknown ones (box B).

Many things spark envy: ownership, status, health, youth, talent, popularity, beauty. It is often confused with jealousy because the physical reactions are identical. The difference: the subject of envy is a thing (status, money, health etc.). The subject of jealousy is the behaviour of a third person. Envy needs two people. Jealousy, on the other hand, requires three: Peter is jealous of Sam because the beautiful girl next door rings him instead.


Aristotle knew this: ‘Potters envy potters.’

In conclusion: be careful when you encounter human stories. Ask for the facts and the statistical distribution behind them. You can still be moved by the story, but this way, you can put it into the right context. If, however, you seek to move and motivate people for your own ends, make sure your tale is seasoned with names and faces.

It’s good if, say, a tailor sticks to what he knows. The déformation professionnelle becomes hazardous when people apply their specialised processes in areas where they don’t belong. Surely you’ve come across some of these: teachers who scold their friends like students. New mothers who begin to treat their husbands like children. Or consider the omnipresent Excel spreadsheet that is featured on every computer:


Zeigarnik and her mentor Kurt Lewin studied this strange behaviour and found that all people function more or less like the waiter. We seldom forget uncompleted tasks; they persist in our consciousness and do not let up, tugging at us like little children, until we give them our attention. On the other hand, once we’ve completed a task and checked it off our mental list, it is erased from memory. The researcher has lent her name to this: scientists now speak of the Zeigarnik effect.


Outstanding tasks gnaw at us only until we have a clear idea of how we will deal with them. Zeigarnik mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase them from memory. But it’s not; a good plan of action suffices.


How much of it comes down to luck, and how much is the fruit of hard work and distinct talent? The question is easily misunderstood. Of course, little is achieved without talent, and nothing is achieved without hard work. Unfortunately, neither skills nor toil and trouble are the key criteria for success. They are necessary – but not sufficient. How do we know this? There is a very simple test: when a person is successful for a long time – more than that, when they enjoy more success in the long run compared to less qualified people – then and only then is talent the essential element. This is not the case with company founders; otherwise, the majority of successful entrepreneurs would, after the first achievement, continue to found and grow second, third and fourth start-ups.


certain people make a living from their abilities, such as pilots, plumbers and lawyers. In other areas, skill is necessary but not critical, as with entrepreneurs and leaders. Finally, chance is the deciding factor in a number of fields, such as in financial markets. Here, the illusion of skill pervades. So: give plumbers due respect and chuckle at successful financial jesters.


Two series of numbers: the first, series A, consists of: 724, 947, 421, 843, 394, 411, 054, 646. What do these numbers have in common? Don’t read on until you have an answer. It’s simpler than you think: the number four features in each of them. Now examine series B: 349, 851, 274, 905, 772, 032, 854, 113. What links these numbers? Do not read further until you’ve figured it out. Series B is more difficult, right? Answer: none use the number six. What can you learn from this? Absence is much harder to detect than presence. In other words, we place greater emphasis on what is present than on what is absent.

people as the ‘masters of their own destinies’. Aristotle proclaimed this 2,500 years ago. Today we know that it is wrong. The notion of free will is up for debate. Our actions are brought about by the interaction of thousands of factors – from genetic predisposition to upbringing, from education to the concentration of hormones between individual brain cells.


The Pope asked Michelangelo: ‘Tell me the secret of your genius. How have you created the statue of David, the masterpiece of all masterpieces?’ Michelangelo’s answer: ‘It’s simple. I removed everything that is not David.’ Let’s be honest. We don’t know for sure what makes us successful. We can’t pinpoint exactly what makes us happy. But we know with certainty what destroys success or happiness. This realisation, as simple as it is, is fundamental: Negative knowledge (what not to do) is much more potent than positive knowledge (what to do).


The Greeks, Romans and medieval thinkers had a term for this approach: via negativa. Literally the negative path, the path of renunciation, of exclusion, of reduction.


Our brains are designed to reproduce rather than search for the truth. In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever convinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets represent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring.

But a cheque has never yet impressed me with the least sense of its intrinsic value. It is a thing so trivial and fragile that the mind refuses to regard it as the equivalent of lands and houses and solid bullion. It is a thing incredible to reason that with a stroke of the pen a man may sign away his thousands. If cheques were prohibited by law, and all payments made in good coin of the realm, I believe we should all be much more careful in our expenditure, for we should have at least some true symbol of what expenditure implies.

At the age of five, I reflected that, if I should live to be seventy, I had only endured, so far, a fourteenth part of my whole life, and I felt the long-spread-out boredom ahead of me to be almost unendurable. In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics. Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more. This is due partly to having discovered what were the things that I most desired and having gradually acquired many of these things. Partly it is due to having successfully dismissed certain objects of desire – such as the acquisition of indubitable knowledge about something or other – as essentially unattainable. But very largely it is due to a diminishing preoccupation with myself. Like others who had a Puritan education, I had the habit of meditating on my sins, follies, and shortcomings.

But pains of these kinds do not destroy the essential quality of life,


Interest in oneself, on the contrary, leads to no activity of a progressive kind. It may lead to the keeping of a diary, to getting psycho-analysed, or perhaps to becoming a monk. But the monk will not be happy until the routine of the monastery has made him forget his own soul. The happiness which he attributes to religion he could have obtained from becoming a crossing-sweeper, provided he were compelled to remain one. External discipline is the only road to happiness for those unfortunates whose self-absorption is too profound to be cured in any other way.


When I speak of ‘the sinner’, I do not mean the man who commits sins: sins are committed by everyone or no one, according to our definition of the word; I mean the man who is absorbed in the consciousness of sin. This man is perpetually incurring his own disapproval, which, if he is religious, he interprets as the disapproval of God.


The primitive man might be proud of being a good hunter, but he also enjoyed the activity of the chase. Vanity, when it passes beyond a point, kills pleasure in every activity for its own sake, and thus leads inevitably to listlessness and boredom. Often its source is diffidence, and its cure lies in the growth of self-respect. But this is only to be gained by successful activity inspired by objective interests.


Alexander the Great was psychologically of the same type as the lunatic, though he possessed the talent to achieve the lunatic’s dream. He could not, however, achieve his own dream, which enlarged its scope as his achievement grew. When it became clear that he was the greatest conqueror known to fame, he decided that he was a God. Was he a happy man? His drunkenness, his furious rages, his indifference to women, and his claim to divinity, suggest that he was not.


Power kept within its proper bounds may add greatly to happiness, but as the sole end of life it leads to disaster, inwardly if not outwardly.


Since no man can be omnipotent, a life dominated wholly by love of power can hardly fail, sooner or later, to meet with obstacles that cannot be overcome.

What people fear when they engage in the struggle is not that they will fail to get their breakfast next morning, but that they will fail to outshine their neighbours. It is very singular how little men seem to realise that they are not caught in the grip of a mechanism from which there is no escape, but that the treadmill is one upon which they remain merely because they have not noticed that it fails to take them up to a higher level. I am thinking, of course, of men in higher walks of business, men who already have a good income and could, if they chose, live on what they have. To do so would seem to them shameful, like deserting from the army in the face of the enemy, though if you ask them what public cause they are serving by their work, they will be at a loss to reply as soon as they have run through the platitudes to be found in the advertisements of the strenuous life.


The working life of this man has the psychology of a hundred-yards race, but as the race upon which he is engaged is one whose only goal is the grave, the concentration, which is appropriate enough for a hundred yards, becomes in the end somewhat excessive.

It never dawns upon them that he is a victim to their greed; nor, indeed, is this quite the truth, any more than suttee is quite what it appeared to a European onlooker.

Almost every American would sooner get 8 per cent from a risky investment than 4 per cent from a safe one. The consequence is that there are frequent losses of money and continual worry and fret. For my part, the thing that I would wish to obtain from money would be leisure with security. But what the typical modern man desires to get with it is more money, with a view to ostentation, splendour, and the outshining of those who have hitherto been his equals.


What I do maintain is that success can only be one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.


As for the learned professions, no outsider can tell whether a doctor really knows much medicine, or whether a lawyer really knows much law, and it is therefore easier to judge of their merit by the income to be inferred from their standard of life.


The rich man of the present day tends to be of quite a different type. He never reads. If he is creating a picture gallery with a view to enhancing his fame, he relies upon experts to choose his pictures; the pleasure that he derives from them is not the pleasure of looking at them, but the pleasure of preventing some other rich man from having them.


Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it, the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom.


The knowledge of good literature, which was universal among educated people fifty or a hundred years ago, is now confined to a few professors. All the quieter pleasures have been abandoned. Some American students took me walking in the spring through a wood on the borders of their campus; it was filled with exquisite wild flowers, but not one of my guides knew the name of even one of them. What use would such knowledge be?

Men and women appear to have become incapable of enjoying the more intellectual pleasures. The art of general conversation, for example, brought to perfection in the French salons of the eighteenth century, was still a living tradition forty years ago.


What use would such knowledge be? It could not add to anybody’s income.


Boredom as a factor in human behaviour has received, in my opinion, far less attention than it deserves. It has been, I believe, one of the great motive powers throughout the historical epoch, and is so at the present day more than ever. Boredom would seem to be a distinctively human emotion.


The opposite of boredom, in a word, is not pleasure, but excitement. The desire for excitement is very deep-seated in human beings, especially in males. I suppose that in the hunting stage it was more easily gratified than it has been since. The chase was exciting, war was exciting, courtship was exciting. A savage will manage to commit adultery with a woman while her husband is asleep beside her, knowing that it is instant death if the husband wakes. This situation, I imagine, is not boring. But with the coming of agriculture life began to grow dull, except, of course, for the aristocrats, who remained, and still remain, in the hunting stage.


In old days, after supper, when the wife and daughters had cleared away the things, everybody sat round and had what was called ‘a happy family time’. This meant that paterfamilias went to sleep, his wife knitted, and the daughters wished they were dead or at Timbuktu. They were not allowed to read, or to leave the room, because the theory was that at that period their father conversed with them, which must be a pleasure to all concerned. With luck they ultimately married and had a chance to inflict upon their children a youth as dismal as their own had been.


We are less bored than our ancestors were, but we are more afraid of boredom. We have come to know, or rather to believe, that boredom is not part of the natural lot of man, but can be avoided by a sufficiently vigorous pursuit of excitement.


the mornings are boring in proportion as the previous evenings were amusing. There will be middle age, possibly even old age. At twenty men think that life will be over at thirty. I, at the age of fifty-eight, can no longer take that view. Perhaps it is as unwise to spend one’s vital capital as one’s financial capital. Perhaps some element of boredom is a necessary ingredient in life.


All great books contain boring portions, and all great lives have contained uninteresting stretches.


Socrates could enjoy a banquet now and again, and must have derived considerable satisfaction from his conversations while the hemlock was taking effect, but most of his life he lived quietly with Xanthippe, taking a constitutional in the afternoon, and perhaps meeting a few friends by the way. Kant is said never to have been more than ten miles from Königsberg in all his life. Darwin, after going round the world, spent the whole of the rest of his life in his own house. Marx, after stirring up a few revolutions, decided to spend the remainder of his days in the British Museum.


The capacity to endure a more or less monotonous life is one which should be acquired in childhood. Modern parents are greatly to blame in this respect; they provide their children with far too many passive amusements, such as shows and good things to eat, and they do not realise the importance to a child of having one day like another, except, of course, for somewhat rare occasions. The pleasures of childhood should in the main be such as the child extracts from his environment by means of some effort and inventiveness. Pleasures which are exciting and at the same time involve no physical exertion, such, for example, as the theatre, should occur very rarely.


For all these reasons a generation that cannot endure boredom will be a generation of little men, of men unduly divorced from the slow processes of nature, of men in whom every vital impulse slowly withers, as though they were cut flowers in a vase.


It is amazing how much both happiness and efficiency can be increased by the cultivation of an orderly mind, which thinks about a matter adequately at the right time rather than inadequately at all times. When a difficult or worrying decision has to be reached, as soon as all the data are available, give the matter your best thought and make your decision; having made the decision, do not revise it unless some new fact comes to your knowledge. Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.


Our doings are not so important as we naturally suppose; our successes and failures do not after all matter very much. Even great sorrows can be survived; troubles which seem as if they must put an end to happiness for life fade with the lapse of time until it becomes almost impossible to remember their poignancy. But over and above these self-centred considerations is the fact that one’s ego is no very large part of the world.


Industrial psychology, it is true, has made elaborate investigations into fatigue, and has proved by careful statistics that if you go on doing something for a sufficiently long time you will ultimately get rather tired – a result which might have been guessed without so much parade of science.


I have found, for example, that if I have to write upon some rather difficult topic the best plan is to think about it with very great intensity – the greatest intensity of which I am capable – for a few hours or days, and at the end of that time give orders, so to speak, that the work is to proceed underground. After some months I return consciously to the topic and find that the work has been done. Before I had discovered this technique, I used to spend the intervening months worrying because I was making no progress; I arrived at the solution none the sooner for this worry,


A process in many ways analogous can be adopted with regard to anxieties. When some misfortune threatens, consider seriously and deliberately what is the very worst that could possibly happen. Having looked this possible misfortune in the face, give yourself sound reasons for thinking that after all it would be no such very terrible disaster. Such reasons always exist, since at the worst nothing that happens to oneself has any cosmic importance.


When you find yourself inclined to brood on anything, no matter what, the best plan always is to think about it even more than you naturally would, until at last its morbid fascination is worn off.


Fortunately, however, there is in human nature a compensating passion, namely that of admiration. Whoever wishes to increase human happiness must wish to increase admiration and to diminish envy.


But, leaving saints out of account, the only cure for envy in the case of ordinary men and women is happiness, and the difficulty is that envy is itself a terrible obstacle to happiness.


But real life is never so logical as this. Merely to realise the causes of one’s own envious feelings is to take a long step towards curing them. The habit of thinking in terms of comparisons is a fatal one. When anything pleasant occurs it should be enjoyed to the full,


If you desire glory, you may envy Napoleon. But Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed. You cannot, therefore, get away from envy by means of success alone, for there will always be in history or legend some person even more successful than you are. You can get away from envy by enjoying the pleasures that come your way, by doing the work that you have to do, and by avoiding comparisons with those whom you imagine, perhaps quite falsely, to be more fortunate than yourself.


The essentials of human happiness are simple, so simple that sophisticated people cannot bring themselves to admit what it is they really lack.


In old days people only envied their neighbours, because they knew little about anyone else. Now through education and the Press they know much in an abstract way about large classes of mankind of whom no single individual is among their acquaintance. Through the movies they think they know how the rich live, through the newspapers they know much of the wickedness of foreign nations, through propaganda they know of the nefarious practices of all whose skin has a pigmentation different from their own.


Whenever you happen to take your children to the Zoo you may observe in the eyes of the apes, when they are not performing gymnastic feats or cracking nuts, a strange strained sadness. One can almost imagine that they feel they ought to become men, but cannot discover the secret of how to do it. On the road of evolution they have lost their way; their cousins marched on and they were left behind. Something of the same strain and anguish seems to have entered the soul of civilised man. He knows there is something better than himself almost within his grasp, yet he does not know where to seek it or how to find it. In despair he rages against his fellow man, who is equally lost and equally unhappy.


An expansive and generous attitude towards other people not only gives happiness to others, but is an immense source of happiness to its possessor, since it causes him to be generally liked. But such an attitude is scarcely possible to the man haunted by a sense of sin. It is an outcome of poise and self-reliance; it demands what may be called mental integration, by which I mean that the various layers of a man’s nature, conscious, subconscious, and unconscious, work together harmoniously and are not engaged in perpetual battle. To produce such harmony is possible in most cases by


What I suggest is that a man should make up his mind with emphasis as to what he rationally believes, and should never allow contrary irrational beliefs to pass unchallenged or obtain a hold over him, however brief.


in friendship, in benevolence, in devotion to science or art, there is nothing that reason should wish to diminish.


The happiness that requires intoxication of no matter what sort is a spurious and unsatisfying kind. The happiness that is genuinely satisfying is accompanied by the fullest exercise of our faculties, and the fullest realisation of the world in which we live.


We expect everybody else to feel towards us that tender love and that profound respect which we feel towards ourselves. It does not occur to us that we cannot expect others to think better of us than we think of them and the reason this does not occur to us is that our own merits are great and obvious, whereas


If we were all given by magic the power to read each other’s thoughts I suppose the first effect would be that almost all friendships would be dissolved; the second effect, however, might be excellent, for a world without any friends would be felt to be intolerable, and we should learn to like each other without needing a veil of illusion to conceal from ourselves that we did not think each other absolutely perfect.


Another not uncommon victim of persecution mania is a certain type of philanthropist who is always doing good to people against their will, and is amazed and horrified that they display no gratitude.


Those who vote, let us say, for a law against cigarette smoking (such laws exist, or existed, in several American States) are obviously non-smokers to whom the pleasure which others derive from tobacco is a source of pain. If they expect those who were previously cigarette fiends to come in a deputation and thank them for emancipation from this odious vice, it is possible that they may be disappointed. They may then begin to reflect that they have given their lives for the public good, and that those who have most reason for thanking them for their beneficent activities appear to be the least aware of any occasion for gratitude.


disillusioned, he retires from the world after the world has retired from him,


The first is: remember that your motives are not always as altruistic as they seem to yourself. The second is: don’t over-estimate your own merits. The third is: don’t expect others to take as much interest in you as you do yourself. And the fourth is: don’t imagine that most people give enough thought to you to have any special desire to persecute you. I


Suspicion of one’s own motives is especially necessary for the philanthropist and the executive; such people have a vision of how the world, or some part of it, should be, and they feel, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, that in realising their vision they will be conferring a boon upon mankind or some section of it. They do not, however, adequately realise that the individuals affected by their operations have each an equal right to his own view as to the sort of world he wants. A man of the executive type is quite sure that his vision is right, and that any contrary one is wrong. But his subjective certainly affords no proof that he is objectively right.


Idealism causes simple motives to wear strange disguises, and therefore some dash of realistic cynicism does not come amiss in our public men.


A man who spent his time seeing that others were fed and forgot to feed himself would perish. He may, of course, take nourishment solely in order to provide himself with the necessary strength to plunge again into the battle against evil, but it is doubtful whether food eaten with this motive could be adequately digested, since the flow of saliva would be insufficiently stimulated. It is better therefore that a man should eat because he enjoys his food than that the time he spends at his meals should be solely inspired by a desire for the public good.


The fourth maxim that we mentioned consists of realising that other people spend less time in thinking about you than you do yourself. The insane victim of persecution mania imagines that all sorts of people, who, in fact, have their own avocations and interests, are occupied morning, noon, and night in an endeavour to work a mischief to the poor lunatic. In


This idea, of course, is flattering to his vanity. If he were a great enough man, it might be true. The actions of the British Government for many years were mainly concerned to thwart Napoleon. But when a person of no special importance imagines that others are personally thinking about him, he is on the road towards insanity. You make a speech, let us say, at some

dog will bark more loudly and bite more readily when people are afraid of him than when they treat him with contempt, and the human herd has something of this same characteristic.


Where the environment is stupid or prejudiced or cruel, it is a sign of merit to be out of harmony with it. And to some degree these characteristics exist in almost every environment. Galileo and Kepler had ‘dangerous thoughts’ (as they are called in Japan), and so have the most intelligent men of our own day. It


a society composed of men and women who do not bow too much to the conventions is a far more interesting society than one in which all behave alike. Where each person’s character is developed individually, differences of type are preserved, and it is worth while to meet new people, because they are not mere replicas of those whom one has met already.


I do not mean that people should be intentionally eccentric, which is just as uninteresting as being conventional. I mean only that people should be natural, and should follow their spontaneous tastes in so far as these are not definitely antisocial.


The man who underestimates himself is perpetually being surprised by success, whereas the man who overestimates himself is just as often surprised by failure. The former kind of surprise is pleasant, the latter unpleasant. It is therefore wise to be not unduly conceited, though also not too modest to be enterprising.


When the public cannot understand a picture or a poem, they conclude that it is a bad picture or a bad poem. When they cannot understand the theory of relativity they conclude (rightly) that their education has been insufficient. Consequently Einstein is honoured while the best painters are left to starve in garrets, and Einstein is happy while the painters are unhappy. Very few men can be genuinely happy in a life involving continual self-assertion against the scepticism of the mass of mankind,


Powerlessness makes people feel that nothing is worth doing, and comfort makes the painfulness of this feeling just endurable.

Some stolid German will discover these cells somewhere in the occipital lobes, another German will agree with him, a third will disagree, and a Russian will glance through the article about the cells and reel off an essay about it to the Syeverny Vyestnik.

To divide men into the successful and the unsuccessful is to look at human nature from a narrow, preconceived point of view. Are you a success or not? Am I? Was Napoleon? Is your servant Vassily?

the extreme excitability, the feeling of guilt, the liability to become exhausted are purely Russian. Germans are never excited, and that is why Germany knows nothing of disappointed, superfluous, or over-tired people…. The excitability of the French is always maintained at one and the same level, and makes no sudden bounds or falls, and so a Frenchman is normally excited down to a decrepit old age. In other words, the French do not have to waste their strength in over-excitement; they spend their powers sensibly, and do not go bankrupt.


He says: "Talent and freshness overcome everything." It is more true to say that talent and freshness can spoil a great deal. In addition to plenty of material and talent, one wants something else which is no less important. One wants to be mature—that is one thing; and for another the feeling of personal freedom is essential, and that feeling has only recently begun to develop in me. I used not to have it before; its place was successfully filled by my frivolity, carelessness, and lack of respect for my work.

I am not a believing man, but of all beliefs I consider his the nearest and most akin to me. Secondly, while Tolstoy is in literature it is easy and pleasant to be a literary man; even recognizing that one has done nothing and never will do anything is not so dreadful, since Tolstoy will do enough for all. His work is the justification of the enthusiasms and expectations built upon literature. Thirdly, Tolstoy takes a firm stand, he has an immense authority, and so long as he is alive, bad tastes in literature, vulgarity of every kind, insolent and lachrymose, all the bristling, exasperated vanities will be in the far background, in the shade.

‘He was always in a sad and melancholy mood,’ Zahir wrote long afterwards, and at all times his eyes were full of tears. In the evenings he used to go in and sit in his oratory, the Tasbih Khana, by himself and would curse the rebels. We were instructed to be present by turns, and one night while I was on duty, we heard the guard asking us all to be alert, and we all put on our turbans and got ready. When the King appeared, we all stood up and greeted him. The King sat in the Tasbih Khana on his low throne, leaning back against a bolster. Then he addressed us saying, ‘do you realize the full consequences of what is happening?’ Shahzada Hamid Khan replied, ‘After one hundred and fifty years your Majesty’s prestige has been restored, and the lost Empire of the Mughals has returned.’ The King shook his head. ‘My children,’ he said, ‘you do not understand. Listen: I did nothing to attract this destruction. I did not have treasures and riches, nor land nor Empire. I was always a beggar, a Sufi sitting in a corner in search of God, with a few people around me, eating my daily bread. But now the great fire that was lit in Meerut has, by the will of the Lord, blown over to Delhi, and it has set this great city alight. Now it seems I and my line are destined to be ruined. The name of the great Timurid [Mughal] Emperors is still alive, but soon that name will be completely destroyed and forgotten. These faithless people [the sepoys] who have rebelled against their masters, and have come here for shelter, will all be gone before long. When these people have been unfaithful to their own leaders what can I expect of them? They have come to ruin my house, and once they have ruined it they will flee. Then the English will cut off my head, and those of my children, and they will display them on top of the Fort. They will not spare any one of you, and if any of you are saved, then remember what I am telling you: even when you will take a morsel of bread in your mouth it will be seized and flung far off from you, and the noblemen of Hindustan will be treated like base villagers.118

## It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences: A Writer's Guide to Crafting Killer Sentences, June Casagrande


A lot of experts say that the best way to remember all the coordinating conjunctions is with the acronym FANBOYS, which represents for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so.


Subordinating conjunctions are a much larger set. They include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, when, and while. A lot of common phrases serve as subordinating conjunctions as well. They include as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, and whether or not. These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, "This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news"


Subordinating conjunctions relegate clauses to a lower grammatical status. Subordination means that what was a whole sentence is whole no more. It's a mere subordinate clause. This is why subordinate clauses are often called dependent clauses: they depend on another clause to make the sentence complete.

Plato’s account he had defiantly told the jury: So long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practising philosophy and exhorting you and elucidating the truth for everyone that I meet … And so gentlemen … whether you acquit me or not, you know that I am not going to alter my conduct, not even if I have to die a hundred deaths.

So long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practising philosophy and exhorting you and elucidating the truth for everyone that I meet … And so gentlemen … whether you acquit me or not, you know that I am not going to alter my conduct, not even if I have to die a hundred deaths. And so he had been led to meet his end in an Athenian jail, his death marking a defining moment in the history of philosophy. An indication of its significance may be the frequency with which it has been painted. In 1650 the French painter Charles-Alphonse Dufresnoy produced a Death of Socrates, now hanging in the Galleria Palatina in Florence (which has no cafeteria). (Ill. 1.3) The eighteenth century witnessed the zenith of interest in Socrates’ death, particularly after Diderot drew attention to its painterly potential in a passage in his Treatise on Dramatic Poetry. Étienne de Lavallée-Poussin, c. 1760 (Ill. 1.4)


If the postcard struck me so forcefully, it was perhaps because the behaviour it depicted contrasted so sharply with my own. In conversations, my priority was to be liked, rather than to speak the truth. A desire to please led me to laugh at modest jokes like a parent on the opening night of a school play.


Philosophy had supplied Socrates with convictions in which he had been able to have rational, as opposed to hysterical, confidence when faced with disapproval.


philosophy suggested by the Greek etymology of the word – philo, love; sophia, wisdom


We stifle our doubts and follow the flock because we cannot conceive of ourselves as pioneers of hitherto unknown, difficult truths.


It is for help in overcoming our meekness that we may turn to the philosopher.


One would never imagine that a good pot or shoe could result from intuition alone; why then assume that the more complex task of directing one’s life could be undertaken without any sustained reflection on premises or goals?


Clay first had to be brought to Athens, usually from a large pit at Cape Kolias 7 miles south of the city, and placed on a wheel, spun at between 50 and 150 rotations per minute, the speed inversely proportional to the diameter of the part being moulded (the narrower the pot, the faster the wheel).


There may be no good reason for things to be the way they are.


Socrates’ method of thinking promised us a way to develop opinions in which we could, even if confronted with a storm, feel veritable confidence.


Socrates tried to answer the charges. He explained that


After brief deliberation 220 decided Socrates wasn’t guilty; 280 that he was. The philosopher responded wryly: ‘I didn’t think the margin would be so narrow.’


If we cannot match such composure, if we are prone to burst into tears after only a few harsh words about our character or achievements, it may be because the approval of others forms an essential part of our capacity to believe that we are right. We feel justified in taking unpopularity seriously not only for pragmatic reasons, for reasons of promotion or survival, but more importantly because being jeered at can seem an unequivocal sign that we have gone astray.


errors in our thought and way of life can at no point and in no way ever be proven simply by the fact that we have run into opposition. What should worry us is not the number of people who oppose us, but how good their reasons are for doing so. We should therefore divert our attention away from the presence of unpopularity to the explanations for it.


As Socrates had learned, the thinking at its basis, though carefully disguised, may be badly awry. Under the influence of passing moods, our critics may have fumbled towards conclusions. They may have acted from impulse and prejudice, and used their status to ennoble their hunches. They may have built up their thoughts like inebriated amateur potters.


Don’t you think it a good principle that one shouldn’t respect all human opinions, but only some and not others … that one should respect the good ones, but not the bad ones?… And good ones are those of people with understanding, whereas bad ones are those of people without it … So my good friend, we shouldn’t care all that much about what the populace will say of us, but about what the expert on matters of justice and injustice will say.


We should not look to Socrates for advice on escaping a death sentence; we should look to him as an extreme example of how to maintain confidence in an intelligent position which has met with illogical opposition.


When the magistrate called for a second, final verdict, 360 members of the jury voted for the philosopher to be put to death. The jurors went home; the condemned man was escorted to prison.


Yet there is a danger that Socrates’ death will seduce us for the wrong reasons. It may foster a sentimental belief in a secure connection between being hated by the majority and being right. It can seem the destiny of geniuses and saints to suffer early misunderstanding, then to be accorded bronze statues by Lysippus. We may be neither geniuses nor saints. We may simply be privileging the stance of defiance over good reasons for it, childishly trusting that we are never so right

There is nothing dreadful in life for the man who has truly comprehended


There is nothing dreadful in life for the man who has truly comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living.


Epicurus’s argument is that if we have money without friends, freedom and an analysed life, we will never be truly happy. And if we have them, but are missing the fortune, we will never be unhappy.


Nothing satisfies the man who is not satisfied with a little.


Having already reached the sunset of my life (being almost on the verge of departure from the world on account of old age), I wanted, before being overtaken by death, to compose a fine anthem to celebrate the fullness of pleasure and so to help now those who are well-constituted. Now, if only one person, or two or three or four or five or six … were in a bad predicament, I should address them individually … but as the majority of people suffer from a common disease, as in a plague, with their false notions about things, and as their number is increasing (for in mutual emulation they catch the disease from each other, like sheep) … I wished to use this stoa to advertise publicly medicines that bring salvation.


Advertising would not be so prevalent if we were not such suggestible creatures. We want things when they are beautifully presented on walls, and lose interest when they are ignored or not well spoken of. Lucretius lamented the way in which what we want is ‘chosen by hearsay rather than by the evidence of [our] own senses’.


When measured by the natural purpose of life, poverty is great wealth; limitless wealth, great poverty.


So in a self-conscious echo of the death in Athens 464 years previously, Seneca asked his doctor to prepare a cup of hemlock. He had long considered Socrates the exemplar of how one might, through philosophy, rise above external circumstance


end … amid all the disturbances of Fortune, he was undisturbed.


I owe my life to [philosophy], and that is the least of my obligations to it.


sources of our satisfaction lie beyond our control and that the world does not reliably conform to our desires.


we best endure those frustrations which we have prepared ourselves for and understand and are hurt most by those we least expected and cannot fathom.


Seneca’s view of the mind, according to which anger results not from an uncontrollable eruption of the passions, but from a basic (and correctable) error of reasoning.


‘Prosperity fosters bad tempers,’ wrote Seneca, after observing his wealthy friends ranting around him because life had not turned out as they had hoped.


[The wise] will start each day with the thought … Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own. Nothing, whether public or private, is stable; the destinies of men, no less than those of cities, are in a whirl.


We live in the middle of things which have all been destined to die. Mortal have you been born, to mortals have you given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything.


Whenever anyone falls at your side or behind you, cry out: ‘Fortune, you will not deceive me, you will not fall upon me confident and heedless. I know what you are planning. It is true that you struck someone else, but you aimed at me.’


Seneca believed in a different picture of the mind. Arguments are like eels: however logical, they may slip from the mind’s weak grasp unless fixed there by imagery and style. We need metaphors to derive a sense of what cannot be seen or touched, or else we will forget.


Seneca more wisely asks us to consider that bad things probably will occur, but adds that they are unlikely ever to be as bad as we fear.


you wish to put off all worry, assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen.


you wish to put off all worry, assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen.


you wish to put off all worry, assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen. Seneca


‘Is this really the condition that I feared?’ … Endure [this poverty] for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more … and I assure you … you will understand that a man’s peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune.


Stop preventing philosophers from possessing money; no one has condemned wisdom to poverty.


It wasn’t hypocrisy. Stoicism does not recommend poverty; it recommends that we neither fear nor despise it.


Never did I trust Fortune, even when she seemed to be offering peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me – money, public office, influence – I relegated to a place from which she could take them back without disturbing me. Between them and me, I have kept a wide gap, and so she has merely taken them, not torn them from me.

When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk, he said, ‘Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher.’


Man is a wretched creature … just listen to him bragging … Is this fellow describing the properties of almighty and everlasting God! In practice, thousands of little women in their villages have lived more gentle, more equable and more constant lives than [Cicero].


Animals knew instinctively how to help themselves when they were sick: goats could pick out dittany from a thousand other plants if they were wounded, tortoises automatically looked for origanum when they were bitten by vipers, and storks could give themselves salt-water enemas.


Tunny-fish were spontaneous experts in astrology. ‘Wherever they may be when they are surprised by the winter solstice, there they remain until the following equinox,’ reported Montaigne. They understood geometry and arithmetic, too, for they swam together in groups in the shape of a perfect cube: ‘If you count one line of them you have the count of the whole school, since the same figure applies to their depth, breadth and length.’


May we not say that there is nothing in us during this earthly prison either purely corporeal or purely spiritual and that it is injurious to tear a living man apart?


Every man calls barbarous anything he is not accustomed to; we have no other criterion of truth or right-reason than the example and form of the opinions and customs of our own country. There we always find the perfect religion, the perfect polity, the most developed and perfect way of doing anything!


If man were wise, he would gauge the true worth of anything by its usefulness and appropriateness to his life.


We readily inquire, ‘Does he know Greek or Latin?’ ‘Can he write poetry and prose?’ But what matters most is what we put last: ‘Has he become better and wiser?’ We ought to find out not who understands most but who understands best. We work merely to fill the memory, leaving the understanding and the sense of right and wrong empty.

Storming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household – and with yourself – not getting slack nor being false to yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.


Socrates makes his soul move with the natural motion of the common people: thus speaks a peasant; thus speaks a woman … His inductions and comparisons are drawn from the most ordinary and best-known of men’s activities; anyone can understand him.


Naturally there were errors in the book (‘I am full of them,’ he boasted), but they weren’t enough to doom the Essays, just as accuracy could not ensure their worth.


It is tempting to quote authors when they express our very own thoughts but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we cannot match. They know us better than we know ourselves. What is shy and confused in us is succinctly and elegantly phrased in them, our pencil lines and annotations in the margins of their books and our borrowings from them indicating where we find a piece of ourselves, a sentence or two built of the very substance of which our own minds are made – a congruence all the more striking if the work was written in an age of togas and animal sacrifices. We invite these words into our books as a homage for reminding us of who we are. But


‘No man has escaped paying the penalty for being born,’ wrote Seneca,


A man may appear to the world as a marvel: yet his wife and his manservant see nothing remarkable about him.


A man may appear to the world as a marvel: yet his wife and his manservant see nothing remarkable about him. Few men have been wonders to their families.


A man may appear to the world as a marvel: yet his wife and his manservant see nothing remarkable about him. Few men have been wonders to their families. We may take this in two ways: that no one is genuinely marvellous, but that only families and staff are close enough to discern the disappointing truth. Or that many people are interesting, but that if they are too close to us in age and place, we are likely not to take them too seriously, on account of a curious bias against what is at hand. Montaigne was not pitying himself; rather, he was using the criticism of more ambitious contemporary works as a symptom of a deleterious impulse to think that the truth always has to lie far from us, in another climate, in an ancient library, in the books of people who lived long ago. It is a question of whether access to genuinely valuable things is limited to a handful of geniuses born between the construction of the Parthenon and the sack of Rome, or whether, as Montaigne daringly proposed, they may be open to you and me as well.


Were I a good scholar, I would find enough in my own experience to make me wise. Whoever recalls to mind his last bout of anger … sees the ugliness of this passion better than in Aristotle. Anyone who recalls the ills he has undergone, those which have threatened him and the trivial incidents which have moved him from one condition to another, makes himself thereby ready for future mutations and the exploring of his condition. Even the life of Caesar is less exemplary for us than our own; a life whether imperial or plebeian is always a life affected by everything that can happen to a man.


Contemplate the restless industry of wretched little ants … the life of most insects is nothing but a restless labour for preparing nourishment and dwelling for the future offspring that will come from their eggs. After the offspring have consumed the nourishment and have turned into the chrysalis stage, they enter into life merely to begin the same task again from the beginning … we cannot help but ask what comes of all of this … there is nothing to show but the satisfaction of hunger and sexual passion, and … a little momentary gratification … now and then, between … endless needs and exertions.


original … Much would have been gained if through timely advice and instruction young people could have had eradicated from their minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer them.


There are fewer stories than there are people on earth, the plots repeated ceaselessly while the names and backdrops alter. ‘The essence of art is that its one case applies to thousands,’ knew Schopenhauer.


We must, between periods of digging in the dark, endeavour always to transform our tears into knowledge.


We know that life consists of suffering, that the harder we try to enjoy it, the more enslaved we are by it, and so we [should] discard the goods of life and practise abstinence.


Nietzsche gradually changed his philosophy of pain and pleasure, and with it, his perspective on difficulty.


Fulfilment was to be reached not by avoiding pain, but by recognizing its role as a natural, inevitable step on the way to reaching anything good.


Hitler greeting Elisabeth Nietzsche in Weimar, October 1935 (Ill.


Really, there is nobody living about whom I care much. The people I like have been dead for a long, long time – for example, the Abbé Galiani, or Henri Beyle, or Montaigne. He could have added another hero, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. These four men were perhaps the richest clues for what Nietzsche came in his maturity to understand by a fulfilled life.


What if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other … you have the choice: either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief … or as much displeasure as possible as the price for the growth of an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys that have rarely been relished yet? If you decide for the former and desire to diminish and lower the level of human pain, you also have to diminish and lower the level of their capacity for joy.


Examine the lives of the best and most fruitful people and peoples and ask yourselves whether a tree that is supposed to grow to a proud height can dispense with bad weather and storms; whether misfortune and external resistance, some kinds of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness, mistrust, hardness, avarice, and violence do not belong among the favourable conditions without which any great growth even of virtue is scarcely possible.


and in the interval between initial failure and subsequent success, in the gap between who we wish one day to be and who we are at present, must come pain, anxiety, envy and humiliation. We suffer because we cannot spontaneously master the ingredients of fulfilment.


The recipe for becoming a good novelist … is easy to give, but to carry it out presupposes qualities one is accustomed to overlook when one says ‘I do not have enough talent.’ One has only to make a hundred or so sketches for novels, none longer than two pages but of such distinctness that every word in them is necessary; one should write down anecdotes every day until one has learnt how to give them the most pregnant and effective form; one should be tireless in collecting and describing human types and characters; one should above all relate things to others and listen to others relate, keeping one’s eyes and ears open for the effect produced on those present, one should travel like a landscape painter or costume designer … one should, finally, reflect on the motives of human actions, disdain no signpost for instruction about them and be a collector of these things by day and night.

Philosophy, as I have hitherto understood and lived it, is a voluntary living in ice and high mountains.


In the mountains of truth you will never climb in vain: either you will get up higher today or you will exercise your strength so as to be able to get up higher tomorrow.

Every pain is an indistinct signal that something is wrong, which may engender either a good or bad result depending on the sagacity and strength of mind of the sufferer. Anxiety may precipitate panic, or an accurate analysis of what is amiss. A sense of injustice may lead to murder, or to a ground-breaking work of economic theory. Envy may lead to bitterness, or to a decision to compete with a rival and the production of a masterpiece.


All lives are difficult; what makes some of them fulfilled as well is the manner in which pains have been met. Every pain is an indistinct signal that something is wrong, which may engender either a good or bad result depending on the sagacity and strength of mind of the sufferer. Anxiety may precipitate panic, or an accurate analysis of what is amiss. A sense of injustice may lead to murder, or to a ground-breaking work of economic theory. Envy may lead to bitterness, or to a decision to compete with a rival and the production of a masterpiece.


Montaigne had explained in the final chapter of the Essays, the art of living lies in finding uses for our adversities: We must learn to suffer whatever we cannot avoid. Our life is composed, like the harmony of the world, of discords as well as of different tones, sweet and harsh, sharp and flat, soft and loud. If a musician liked only some of them, what could he sing? He has got to know how to use all of them and blend them together. So too must we with good and ill, which are of one substance with our life. And some 300 years later, Nietzsche returned to the thought: If only we were fruitful fields, we would at bottom let nothing perish unused and see in every event, thing and man welcome manure.


Raphael had not spontaneously come into possession of his talents; he had become great by responding intelligently to a sense of inferiority that would have led lesser men to despair.


Don’t talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name all kinds of great men who were not very gifted. They acquired greatness, became ‘geniuses’ (as we put it) through qualities about whose lack no man aware of them likes to speak: all of them had that diligent seriousness of a craftsman, learning first to construct the parts properly before daring to make a great whole. They allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole.


Christianity had, in Nietzsche’s account, emerged from the minds of timid slaves in the Roman Empire who had lacked the stomach to climb to the tops of mountains, and so had built themselves a philosophy claiming that their bases were delightful.


## The Art of Happiness, 10th Anniversary Edition: A Handbook for Living, Dalai Lama


Our feelings of contentment are strongly influenced by our tendency to compare.


In Buddhism, for instance, there is a reference to the four factors of fulfillment, or happiness: wealth, worldly satisfaction, spirituality, and enlightenment. Together they embrace the totality of an individual’s quest for happiness.


“As long as there is a lack of the inner discipline that brings calmness of mind, no matter what external facilities or conditions you have, they will never give you the feeling of joy and happiness that you are seeking.


“Sometimes it seems that our whole culture, Western culture, is based on material acquisition; we’re surrounded, bombarded, with ads for the latest things to buy, the latest car and so on. It’s difficult not to be influenced by that. There are so many things we want, things we desire. It never seems to stop. Can you speak a bit about desire?”


When it comes to dealing with greed, one thing that is quite characteristic is that although it arrives by the desire to obtain something, it is not satisfied by obtaining. Therefore, it becomes sort of limitless, sort of bottomless, and that leads to trouble. One interesting thing about greed is that although the underlying motive is to seek satisfaction, the irony is that even after obtaining the object of your desire, you are still not satisfied. The true antidote of greed is contentment.


how can we achieve inner contentment?


framing any decision we face by asking ourselves, “Will it bring me happiness?”


“So, the first step in seeking happiness is learning.


in the case of everyday experiences, if there are certain types of events that you do not desire, then the best method of ensuring that that event does not take place is to make sure that the causal conditions that normally give rise to that event no longer arise. Similarly, if you want a particular event or experience to occur, then the logical thing to do is to seek and accumulate the causes and conditions that give rise to it. “This is also the case with mental states and experiences. If you desire happiness, you should seek the causes that give rise to it, and if you don’t desire suffering, then what you should do is to ensure that the causes and conditions that would give rise to it no longer arise. An appreciation of this causal principle is very important.


‘Did I utilize this day as I planned?’ If it went accordingly, then you should rejoice. If it went wrong, then regret what you did and critique the day. So, through methods such as this, you can gradually strengthen the positive aspects of the mind.


first learn about the positive value of the practices, then build up determination, and then try to implement them. At the beginning, the implementation of the positive practices is very small, so the negative influences are still very powerful. However, eventually, as you gradually build up the positive practices, the negative behaviors are automatically diminished. So, actually the practice of Dharma1 is a constant battle within, replacing previous negative conditioning or habituation with new positive conditioning.”


If it’s natural for us to want to avoid suffering, why aren’t we spontaneously and naturally more and more repulsed by the negative or unwholesome behaviors as we grow older?

Notes: 1) i believe we always work towards happiness but sometimes small or fake happiness takes a worng turn.to understand  happiness together with its repurcussions we have to have a clear vision and acute awareness or intelligence. 


## How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life, Scott Adams


Goals are for losers. Your mind isn’t magic. It’s a moist computer you can program. The most important metric to track is your personal energy. Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success. Happiness is health plus freedom. Luck can be managed, sort of. Conquer shyness by being a huge phony (in a good way). Fitness is the lever that moves the world. Simplicity transforms ordinary into amazing.


people who routinely disagree with you. See how confident they look while being dead wrong? That’s exactly how you look to them.


The best example of the power of simplicity is capitalism. The central genius of capitalism is that all of its complexities, all of the differences across companies, all of the challenges, decisions, successes, and failures can be boiled down into one number: profits.


But that is the risk of any tool. A hammer is good only if you stop pounding after the nail is all the way in.


But that is the risk of any tool. A hammer is good only if you stop pounding after the nail is all the way in. Keep pounding and you break the wood.


The short answer is that over the years I have cultivated a unique relationship with failure. I invite it. I survive it. I appreciate it. And then I mug the shit out of it.


Failure always brings something valuable with it. I don’t let it leave until I extract that value. I have a long history of profiting from failure. My


When I was a commercial loan officer for a large bank in San Francisco, my boss taught us that you should never make a loan to someone who is following his passion.


My boss, who had been a commercial lender for over thirty years, said the best loan customer is one who has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at something that looks good on a spreadsheet.


It’s easy to be passionate about things that are working out, and that distorts our impression of the importance of passion.


Success caused passion


If success were easy, everyone would do it. It takes effort. That fact works to your advantage because it keeps lazy people out of the game.


want my failures to make me stronger, of course, but I also want to become smarter, more talented, better networked, healthier, and more energized.


This was about the time I started to understand that timing is often the biggest component of success. And since timing is often hard to get right unless you are psychic, it makes sense to try different things until you get the timing right by luck.


The second thing I learned on that flight—or confirmed, really—is that appearance matters. By the end of the flight, the CEO had handed me his card and almost guaranteed me a job at his company if I wanted it. Had I boarded the flight wearing my ratty jeans, threadbare T-shirt, and worn-out sneakers, things would have gone differently. Throughout my career I’ve had my antennae up, looking for examples of people who use systems as opposed to goals. In most cases, as far as I can tell, the people who use systems do better. The systems-driven people have found a way to look at the familiar in new and more useful ways.


The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavors. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system.


For our purposes, let’s say a goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. Language


Systems have no deadlines, and on any given day you probably can’t tell if they’re moving you in the right direction.


This was about the time that my opinion of experts, and authority figures in general, began a steady descent that continues to this day.


We humans are wired to be easily influenced by the people who are in relationships with us, no matter what those relationships are. Sometimes we call that influence peer pressure. Sometimes it’s called modeling or imitating. Sometimes it’s learning by example. And most of the time it’s just something we do automatically, without thinking.


Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the obvious steps. But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up. When


Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the obvious steps. But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up. When I get my personal energy right, the quality of my work is better, and I can complete it faster. That keeps my career on track. And when all of that is working, and I feel relaxed and energetic, my personal life is better too.


The risk with using energy as your guide is that there are plenty of bad choices that also get you energized in the short run. But realistically, we all know, for example, that shoving cocaine up our noses isn’t a good long-term strategy. The dumb choices are generally quite obvious.


The power of daydreaming is similar to the power of well-made movies that can make you cry or make you laugh. Your body and your mind will respond automatically to whatever images you spend the most time pondering. If you imagine winning a Nobel Prize, buying


The daydreaming strategy is more of an everyday practice. It won’t get you out of a deep slump. For the truly bad moods, exercise, nutrition, sleep, and time are the smart buttons to push.

When you can release on your ego long enough to view your perceptions as incomplete or misleading, it gives you the freedom to imagine new and potentially more useful ways of looking at the world.


Seekers obviously find more stuff than the people who sit and wait.


It’s a cliché that who you know is helpful for success. What is less obvious is that you don’t need to know CEOs and billionaires. Sometimes you just need a friend who knows different things than you do.


Overcoming obstacles is normally an unavoidable part of the process. But you also need to know when to quit. Persistence is useful, but there’s no point in being an idiot about it.


To put the success formula into its simplest form: Good + Good > Excellent Successwise, you’re better off being good at two complementary skills than being excellent at one.


Several years ago I gave a talk to a fifth-grade class. I started by asking them to finish my sentence. The sentence was “If you play a slot machine long enough, eventually you will …” The class yelled out in unison “WIN!” As most adults know, that is exactly the wrong answer. Slot machines are engineered to make everyone but the casino a loser in the long run. But kids don’t know that. I presume they confused the benefits of persistence, which is drilled into them as kids, with the actual odds of succeeding.


My natural optimism always tells me I’m going to pull a rabbit out of the hat and win against all odds no matter how far behind I am. That feeling is so strong in me that the only reason it isn’t classified as mental illness is that it works more often than you’d expect.


The point is that while we all think we know the odds in life, there’s a good chance you have some blind spots. Finding those blind spots is a big deal.

The most important is the transformative power of praise versus the corrosive impact of criticism. I’ve had a number of occasions since then to test the powers of praise, and I find it an amazing force, especially for adults. Children are accustomed to a continual stream of criticisms and praise, but adults can go weeks without a compliment while enduring criticism


The most important is the transformative power of praise versus the corrosive impact of criticism. I’ve had a number of occasions since then to test the powers of praise, and I find it an amazing force, especially for adults. Children are accustomed to a continual stream of criticisms and praise, but adults can go weeks without a compliment while enduring criticism both at work and at home. Adults are starved for a kind word. When you understand the power of honest praise (as opposed to bullshitting, flattery, and sucking up), you realize that withholding it borders on immoral. If you see something that impresses you, a decent respect to humanity insists you voice your praise. “Wow.


The most common is the L-shaped layout. You imagine a giant letter L on the page and fill in the dense stuff along its shape, leaving less clutter in one of the four open quadrants.


You can change it up by rotating the L and leaving a different quadrant less busy than the rest, but it’s still the L concept.


When you talk about the hypothetical future, use “were” instead of “was.” Don’t say, “If I was to go with you, I would enjoy myself.” Say, “If I were to go with you,


“Hopefully” Most people misuse the word “hopefully.” It’s bad grammar to say, “Hopefully, she will bring the dessert.” “Hopefully” should be an adverb. Say instead, “We waited hopefully for dessert.” In the latter case, “hopefully” is correctly modifying the verb “waited.”


The simple rule for “I” versus “me” is that the sentence has to make sense if you remove the other person mentioned in the sentence. For example, if you say, “Bob and I went to a movie,” it would still make sense if you removed “Bob and” and said, “I went to a movie.” If the sentence is “Please give the documents to Bob and me,” you can remove “Bob and” and it still makes sense as “Please give the documents to me.” You’ll often hear smart people get this rule wrong, so don’t be fooled by how many times you hear it incorrectly.

When the subject is plural, as in “friends,” you use “fewer”:


Nonscientists often use the word “theory” when they should say “hypothesis.” Without getting too technical, a theory is a scientific explanation of reality that is so well tested that it is as good as a fact. The correct term for an unproven and untested explanation is “hypothesis.”


Given our human impulse to pick up the habits and energy of others, you can use that knowledge to literally program your brain the way you want. Simply find the people who most represent what you would like to become and spend as much time with them as you can without trespassing, kidnapping, or stalking. Their good habits and good energy will rub off on you.


A mediocre meal when you’re starving will contribute more to your happiness than an extraordinary meal when you’re not hungry. The timing of things can be more important than the intrinsic value of the things.


You need to control the order and timing of things to be happy. It’s important to look at happiness in terms of timing because timing is easier to control than resources.


You need to control the order and timing of things to be happy. It’s important to look at happiness in terms of timing because timing is easier to control than resources. It’s hard to become rich enough to buy your own private island but, relatively speaking, it’s easier to find a job with flexible hours.


Slow and steady improvement at anything makes you feel that you are on the right track. The feeling of progress stimulates your body to create the chemicals that make you feel happy.


No one wants to believe that the formula for happiness is as simple as daydreaming, controlling your schedule, napping, eating right, and being active every day. You’d feel like an idiot for suffering so many unhappy days while not knowing the cure was so accessible.


Recapping the happiness formula: Eat right. Exercise. Get enough sleep. Imagine an incredible future (even if you don’t believe it). Work toward a flexible schedule. Do things you can steadily improve at. Help others (if you’ve already helped yourself). Reduce daily decisions to routine.


My worldview is that every element of your personality, from your perseverance to your risk tolerance to your ambition to your intelligence, is a product of pure chance. You needed the genes you were born with and the exact experiences of your life to create the person you are with the opportunities you have. Every decision you make is a simple math product of those variables.


learning multiple skills makes your odds of success dramatically higher than learning one skill. If you learn to control your ego, you can pick strategies that scare off the people who fear embarrassment, thus allowing you to compete against a smaller field.


And always remember that failure is your friend. It is the raw material of success. Invite it in. Learn from it. And don’t let it leave until you pick its pocket. That’s a system.

if I have a particular compulsion, can I look at that compulsion without being occupied with it?


Occupation implies the effort to resolve that compulsion,

only those who are capable of breaking away from all conditioning can discover that which is not measurable by the mind.


everywhere society is conditioning the individual, and this conditioning takes the form of self-improvement, which is really the perpetuation of the ‘me’, the ego, in different forms. Self-improvement may be gross, or it may be very, very refined when it becomes the practice of virtue, goodness, the so-called love of one’s neighbor, but essentially it is the continuance of the ‘me’,

## Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (Complete), Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa


after having been besmeared with it. And, O Yudhishthira, it behoveth thee not to covet anything! And if thou wouldst have virtue, emancipate thyself from desire of worldly possessions!'


and bringeth on every kind of woe. Verily affection is the root of all misery and of all fear, of joy and grief of every kind of pain. From affection spring all purposes, and it is from affection that spring the love of worldly goods! Both of these (latter) are sources of evil, though the first (our purposes) is worse than the second. And as (a small portion of) fire thrust into the hollow of a tree consumeth the tree itself to its roots, even so affection, ever so little, destroyeth both virtue and profit. He cannot be regarded to have renounced the world who hath merely withdrawn from worldly possessions. He, however, who though in actual contact with the world


regardeth its faults, may be said to have truly renounced the world. Freed from every evil passion, soul dependent on nothing with such a one hath truly renounced the world. Therefore, should no one seek to place his affections on either friends or the wealth he hath earned. And so should affection for one's own person be extinguished by knowledge. Like the lotus-leaf that is never drenched by water, the souls of men capable of distinguishing between the ephemeral and the everlasting, of men devoted to the pursuit of the eternal, conversant with the scriptures and purified by knowledge, can never be moved by affection. The man that is influenced by


affection is tortured by desire; and from the desire that springeth up in his heart his thirst for worldly possessions increaseth. Verily, this thirst is sinful and is regarded as the source of all anxieties. It is this terrible thirst, fraught with sin that leaneth unto unrighteous acts. Those find happiness that can renounce this thirst, which can never be renounced by the wicked, which decayeth not with the decay of the body, and which is truly a fatal disease! It hath neither beginning nor end. Dwelling within the heart, it destroyeth creatures, like a fire of incorporeal origin. And as a faggot of wood is consumed by the fire that is fed by itself, even so doth a person


of impure soul find destruction from the covetousness born of his heart. And as creatures endued with life have ever a dread of death, so men of wealth are in constant apprehension of the king and the thief, of water and fire and even of their relatives. And as a morsel of meat, if in air, may be devoured by birds; if on ground by beasts of prey; and if in water by the fishes; even so is the man of wealth exposed to dangers wherever he may be. To many the wealth they own is their bane, and he that beholding happiness in wealth becometh wedded to it, knoweth not true happiness. And hence accession of wealth is viewed as that which increaseth covetousness and folly. Wealth


alone is the root of niggardliness and boastfulness, pride and fear and anxiety! These are the miseries of men that the wise see in riches! Men undergo infinite miseries in the acquisition and retention of wealth. Its expenditure also is fraught with grief. Nay, sometimes, life itself is lost for the sake of wealth! The abandonment of wealth produces misery, and even they that are cherished by one's wealth become enemies for the sake of that wealth! When, therefore, the possession of wealth is fraught with such misery, one should not mind its loss. It is the ignorant alone who are discontented. The wise, however, are always content. The thirst of wealth can never be assuaged.


Contentment is the highest happiness; therefore, it is, that the wise regard contentment as the highest object of pursuit. The wise knowing the instability of youth and beauty, of life and treasure-hoards, of prosperity and the company of the loved ones, never covet them. Therefore, one should refrain from the acquisition of wealth, bearing the pain incident to it. None that is rich free from trouble, and it is for this that the virtuous applaud them that are free from the desire of wealth. And as regards those that pursue wealth for purposes of virtue, it is better for them to refrain altogether from such pursuit, for, surely, it is better not to touch mire at all than to wash it off


islands. Thou alone are engaged in the welfare of the three worlds. If thou dost not rise, the universe becometh blind and the learned cannot employ themselves in the attainment of virtue, wealth and profit. It is through thy grace that the (three) orders of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas are able to perform their various duties and sacrifices.[13] Those versed in chronology say that thou art the beginning and thou the end of a day of Brahma, which consisteth of a full thousand Yugas. Thou art the lord of Manus and of the sons of the Manus, of the universe and of man, of the Manwantaras, and their lords. When the time of universal dissolution cometh, the


fire Samvartaka born of thy wrath consumeth the three worlds and existeth alone And clouds of various hues begotten of thy rays, accompanied by the elephant Airavata and the thunderbolt, bring about the appointed deluges. And dividing thyself into twelve parts and becoming as many suns, thou drinkest up the ocean once more with thy rays. Thou art called Indra, thou art Vishnu, thou art Brahma, thou art Prajapati. Thou art fire and thou art the subtle mind. And thou art lord and the eternal Brahma. Thou art Hansa, thou art Savitri, thou art Bhanu, Ansumalin, and Vrishakapi. Thou art Vivaswan, Mihira, Pusha, Mitra, and Dharma. Thou art thousand-rayed,


thou art Aditya, and Tapana, and the lord of rays. Thou art Martanda, and Arka, and Ravi, and Surya and Saranya and maker of day, and Divakara and Suptasaspti, and Dhumakeshin and Virochana. Thou art spoken of as swift of speed and the destroyer of darkness, and the possessor of yellow steeds. He that reverentially adoreth thee on the sixth or the seventh lunar day with humility and tranquillity of mind, obtaineth the grace of Lakshmi. They that with undivided attention adore and worship thee, are delivered from all dangers, agonies, and afflictions. And they that hold that thou art everywhere (being the soul of all things) living


long, freed from sin and enjoying an immunity from all diseases. O lord of all food, it behoveth thee to grant food in abundance unto me who am desirous of food even for entertaining all my guests with reverence. I bow also to all those followers of thine that have taken refuge at thy feet Mathara and Aruna and Danda and others, including Asani and Kshuva and the others. And I bow also to the celestial mothers of all creatures, viz., Kshuva and Maitri and the others of the class. O, let them deliver me their supplient.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard what the intention is of Dhritarashtra and his own. All that Sanjaya, O Krishna, said unto me hath certainly the assent of Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's soul, and spoke out his mind. An envoy speaketh according to his instructions, for if he speaketh otherwise he deserveth to be slain. Without looking equally on all that are his, moved by avarice and a sinful heart, Dhritarashtra seeketh to make peace with us without giving us back our kingdom. Indeed, at Dhritarashtra's command we spent twelve years in the woods and one additional year in concealment, well-believing, O lord, that Dhritarashtra would abide firmly by that pledge of ours. That we did not deviate from our promise is well-known to the Brahmanas who were with us. The covetous king Dhritarashtra, is now unwilling to observe Kshatriya virtues. Owing to affection for his son, he is listening to the counsels of wicked men. Abiding by counsels of Suyodhana, the king, O Janardana, actuated by avarice and seeking his own good, behaveth untruthfully towards us. What can be more sorrowful, O Janardana, than this, that I am unable to maintain my mother and my friends? Having the Kasis, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Matsyas, for my allies and with thee, O slayer of Madhu, for my protector, I prayed for only five villages, etc., Avishthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, with any other, O Govinda, as the fifth; Grant us, we said, five villages or towns, O sire, where we five may dwell in union, for we do not desire the destruction of the Bharatas. The wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra, however, regarding the lordship of the world to be; in him, doth not agree to even that. What can be more sorrowful than this? When a man born and brought up in a respectable family, covereth the possessions of others, that avarice of his destroyeth his intelligence; and intelligence being destroyed, shame is lost; and loss of shame leadeth to diminution of virtue; and loss of virtue bringeth on loss of prosperity, Destruction of prosperity, in its turn, ruineth a person, for poverty is a person's death. Kinsmen and friends and Brahmanas shun a poor man as birds avoid, O Krishna, a tree that beareth neither Rower nor fruits. Even this, O sire, is death to me that kinsmen shun me, as if I were a fallen one like the breath of life quitting 'a dead body. Samvara said that no condition of life could be more distressful than that in which one is always racked by the anxiety caused by the thought I have no meat for today, what will become of me tomorrow? It is said that wealth is the highest virtue, and everything depends on wealth. They that have wealth are said to live, whereas those that are without wealth are more dead than alive. They that by violence rob a man of his wealth not only kill the robbed but destroy also his virtue, profit and pleasure. Some men when overtaken by poverty choose death; others remove from cities to hamlets others retire into the wood; while others, again, become religious mendicants to destroy their lives. Some for the sake of wealth are driven to madness; others for wealth, live under Subjection to their foes; while many others, again, for the sake of wealth, betake themselves to the servitude of others. A man's poverty is even more distressful to him than death, for wealth is the sole cause or virtue and pleasure. The natural death of a person is not much regarded, for that is the eternal path of all creatures. Indeed, none among created beings can transgress it. O Krishna, a man who is poor from birth is not so much distressed as one, who, having once possessed great prosperity and having been brought up in luxury, is deprived of that prosperity. Having through his own fault fallen into distress, such a person blameth the very gods with Indra and his own self. Indeed, knowledge of even the entire scriptures faileth to mitigate his pains. Sometimes he getteth angry with his servants, and sometimes he cherisheth malice towards even his well-wishers. Subject to constant anger, he loseth his very senses, and his senses being clouded, he practiseth evil deeds. Through sinfulness such a person contributeth to a fusion of castes. A fusion of castes leadeth to hell and is the foremost of all sinful acts. If he is not awakened in time, he goeth, certainly, O Krishna, to hell, and, indeed, wisdom is the only thing that can awaken him, for if he obtaineth back the eye of wisdom, he is saved. When wisdom is regained, such a man turneth his attention to scriptures; and attention to scriptures aideth his virtue. Then shame becometh his best ornament. He that hath shame hath an aversion against sin, and his prosperity also increaseth; and he that hath prosperity truly becometh a man. He that is ever devoted to virtue, and hath his mind under control, and always acteth after deliberation, never inclineth towards unrighteousness and never engageth in any act that is sinful. He that is without shame and sense is neither man nor woman. He is incapable of earning religious merit, and is like a Sudra. He that hath shame gratifieth the gods, the Pitris, and even his own self, and by this he obtaineth emancipation, which indeed, is the highest aim of all righteous persons.' 'Thou hast, O slayer of Madhu, seen all this in me with thy own eyes. It is not unknown to thee, how, deprived of kingdom, we have lived these years. We cannot lawfully abandon that prosperity (which had been ours). Our first-efforts will be such that, O Madhava, both ourselves and the Kauravas, united in peace, will quietly enjoy our prosperity. Otherwise, we shall, after slaying the worst of the Kauravas, regain those provinces, although success through bloodshed by destruction of even despicable foes that are related to us so dearly is the worst of all fierce deeds, O Krishna. We have numerous kinsmen, and numerous also are the revered seniors that have taken this or that other side. The slaughter of these would be highly sinful. What good, therefore, can there be in battle? Alas, such sinful practices are the duties of the Kshatriya order! Ourselves have taken our births in that wretched order! Whether those practices be sinful or virtuous, any other than the profession of arms would be censurable for us. A Sudra serveth; a Vaisya liveth by trade; the Brahmana have choosen the wooden bowl (for begging), while we are to live by slaughter! A Kshatriya, slayeth a Kshatriya; fishes live on fish; a dog preyeth upon a dog! Behold, O thou of the Dasarha race, how each of these followeth his peculiar virtue. O Krishna, Kali is ever present in battle-fields; lives are lost all around. It is true, force regulated by policy is invoked; yet success and defeat are independent of the will of the combatants. The lives also of creatures are independent of their own wishes, and neither weal nor woe can be one's when the time is not come for it, O best of the Yadu's race. Sometimes one man killeth many, sometimes many and united together kill one. A coward may slay a hero, and one unknown to fame may stay a hero of celebrity. Both parties cannot win success, nor both be defeated. The loss, however, on both sides may be equal. If one flieth away, loss of both life and fame is his. Under all circumstances, however, war is a sin. Who in striking another is not himself struck? As regard the person, however, who is struck, victory and defeat, O Hrishikesa, are the same. It is true that defeat is not much removed from death, but his loss also, O Krishna, is not less who winneth victory. He himself may not be killed, but his adversaries will kill at least some one that is dear to him, or some others and thus the man, O sire, deprived of strength and not seeing before him his sons and brothers, becometh indifferent, O Krishna, to life itself. Those that are quiet, modest, virtuous, and compassionate, are generally slain in battle, while they that are wicked escape. Even after slaying one's foes, repentance, O Janardana, possesseth the heart. He that surviveth among the foes giveth trouble, for the survivor, collecting a force, seeketh to destroy the surviving victor. In hopes of terminating the dispute, one often seeketh to exterminate the foe. Thus victory createth animosity, and he that is defeated liveth in sorrow. He that is peaceful, sleepeth in happiness, giving up all thoughts of victory and defeat, whereas he that hath provoked hostility always sleepeth in misery, with, indeed, an anxious heart, as if sleeping with a snake in the same room. He that exterminates seldom winneth fame. On the other hand, such a person reapeth eternal infamy in the estimation of all. Hostilities, waged over so long, cease not; for if there is even one alive in the enemy's family, narrators are never wanted to remind him of the past. Enmity, O Kesava, is never neutralised by enmity; on the other hand, it is fomented by enmity, like fire fed by clarified butter. Therefore, there can be no peace without the annihilation of one party, for flaws may always be detected of which advantage may be taken by one side or other. They that are engaged in watching for flaws have this vice. Confidence in one's own prowess troubleth the core of one's heart like an incurable disease. Without either renouncing that at once, or death, there can be no peace. It is true, O slayer of Madhu, that exterminating the foe by the very roots, may lead to good result in the shape of great prosperity, yet such an act is most cruel. The peace that may be brought about by our renouncing the kingdom is hardly different from death, which is implied by the loss of kingdom, in consequence of the design of the enemy and the utter ruin of ourselves. We do not wish to give u the kingdom, nor do we wish to see the extinction of our race. Under these circumstances, therefore, the peace that is obtained through eve humiliation is the best. When these that strive for peace by all means without of course wishing for war, find conciliation fail, war becomes in evitable, and then is the time for the display of prowess. Indeed, when conciliation fails, frightful results follow. The learned have noticed all this in a canine contest. First, there comes the wagging of tails, then the bark, then the bark in reply, then the circumambulation, then the showing of teeth, then repeated roars, and then at last the fight. In such a contest, O Krishna., the dog that is stronger, vanquishing his antagonist, taketh the latter's meat. The same is exactly the case with men. There is no difference whatever. They that are powerful should be indifferent to avoid disputes with the weak who always bow down. The father, the king, and he that is venerable in year, always deserve regard. Dhritarashtra, therefore, O Janardana, is worthy of our respect and worship. But, O Madhava, Dhritarashtra's affection for his son is great. Obedient to his son, he will reject our submission.


Dhritrastra is only asking questions, but has no desire to follow any of them. It is action which matters and not mere knowledge or knowing. He wants to hear something which conforms to his own actions, and thus there arises no need of taking a different course of action.


"Sanjaya said, 'The auspicious names (of Kesava) have been previously heard by me. Of those I will tell thee as many as I know. Kesava, however, is immeasurable, being above the power of speech to describe. He is called Vasudeva in consequence of his enveloping all creatures with the screen of illusion, or of his glorious splendour, or of his being the support and resting-place of the gods. He is called Vishnu because of his all-pervading nature. He is called Madava, O Bharata, because of his practising as a Muni, concentration of mind on truth and Yoga-absorption. He is called Madhusudana because of his having slain the Asura Madhu, and also because of his being the substance of the twenty-four objects of knowledge. Born of the Sattwata race, he is called Krishna because he uniteth in himself what are implied by the two words Krishi which signifieth 'what existeth' and na which signifieth 'eternal peace'. He is called Pundarikaksha from Pundarika implying his high and eternal abode, and Aksha implying 'indestructible'; and he is called Janardana because he striketh fear into the hearts of all wicked beings. He is called Sattwata, because the attribute of Sattwa is never dissociated from him and also because he is never dissociated from it; and he is called Vrishabhakshana from Vrishabha implying the 'Vedas' and ikshana implying 'eye', the union of the two signifying that the Vedas are his eyes, or the Vedas are the eyes through which he may be seen, That conqueror of hosts is called Aja, or unborn', because he hath not taken his birth from any being in the ordinary way. That Supreme Soul is called Damodara because unlike the gods his effulgence is increate and his own, and also because he hath self-control and great splendour. He is called Hrishikesa, from Hrishika meaning 'eternal happiness' and Isa meaning 'the six divine attributes', the union signifying one having joy, happiness, and divinity. He is called Mahavahu, because he upholdeth the earth and the sky with his two arms. He is called Adhakshaja, because he never falleth down or suffereth any deterioration, and is called Narayana from his being the refuge of all human beings. He is called Purusottama from Puru implying 'he that createth and preserveth' and so meaning 'he that destroyeth, the union signifying one that createth, preserveth, and destroyeth the universe'. He possesseth a knowledge of all things, and, therefore, is called Sarva, Krishna is always in Truth and Truth is always in him, and Govinda is Truth's Truth. Therefore, he is called Satya. He is called Vishnu because of his prowess, and Jishnu because of his success. He is called Ananta from his eternity, and Govinda from his knowledge of speech of every kind. He maketh the unreal appear as real and thereby beguileth all creatures. Possessed of such attributes, ever devoted to righteousness, and endued with divinity, the slayer of Madhu, that mighty-armed one incapable of decay, will come hither for preventing the slaughter of the Kurus.'"


## The Forty Rules of Love, Elif Shafak


Patience does not mean to passively endure. It means to be farsighted enough to trust the end result of a process. What does patience mean? It means to look at the thorn and see the rose, to look at the night and see the dawn. Impatience means to be so shortsighted as to not be able to see the outcome. The lovers of God never run out of patience, for they know that time is needed for the crescent moon to become full.


Try not to resist the changes that come your way. Instead let life live through you. And do not worry that your life is turning upside down. How do you know that the side you are used to is better than the one to come?


Personally, I didn’t think there was anything wrong with sadness. Just the opposite—hypocrisy made people happy, and truth made them sad.


Happy birthday! Forty is a most beautiful age for both men and women. Did you know that in mystic thought forty symbolizes the ascent from one level to a higher one and spiritual awakening? When we mourn we mourn for forty days. When a baby is born it takes forty days for him to get ready to start life on earth. And when we are in love we need to wait for forty days to be sure of our feelings. The Flood of Noah lasted forty days, and while the waters destroyed life, they also washed all impurity away and enabled human beings to make a new, fresh start. In Islamic mysticism there are forty degrees between man and God. Likewise, there are four basic stages of consciousness and ten degrees in each, making forty levels in total. Jesus went into the wilderness for forty days and nights. Muhammad was forty years old when he received the call to become a prophet. Buddha meditated under a linden tree for forty days. Not to mention the forty rules of Shams. You receive a new mission at forty, a new lease on life! You have reached a most auspicious number. Congratulations! And don’t worry about getting old. There are no wrinkles or gray hair strong enough to defy the power of forty!

“Fret not where the road will take you. Instead concentrate on the first step. That’s the hardest part and that’s what you are responsible for. Once you take that step let everything do what it naturally does and the rest will follow. Do not go with the flow. Be the flow.”


The past is an interpretation. The future is an illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, proceeding from the past to the future. Instead time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within the present moment.


One day a man came running to a Sufi and said, panting, “Hey, they are carrying trays, look over there!” The Sufi answered calmly, “What is it to us? Is it any of my business?” “But they are taking those trays to your house!” the man exclaimed. “Then is it any of your business?” the Sufi said.


“God is a meticulous clockmaker. So precise is His order that everything on earth happens in its own time. Neither a minute late nor a minute early. And for everyone without exception, the clock works accurately. For each there is a time to love and a time to die.”


“It is never too late to ask yourself, ‘Am I ready to change the life I am living? Am I ready to change within?’ “Even if a single day in your life is the same as the day before, it surely is a pity. At every moment and with each new breath, one should be renewed and renewed again. There is only one way to be born into a new life: to die before death.”


While the parts change, the whole always remains the same. For every thief who departs this world, a new one is born. And every decent person who passes away is replaced by a new one. In this way not only does nothing remain the same but also nothing ever really changes. For every Sufi who dies, another is born somewhere.

So is it with any activity; failure and success are two aspects of reality which at the start are not perceptible. That is what makes criticism so easy and art so difficult: the critic is always in a good position to show the limits that every artist gives himself in choosing himself;


## Treatises on Friendship and Old Age, Marcus Tullius Cicero


Nature, the best of guides, as I would a god, and am loyal to her commands. It is not likely, if she has written the rest of the play well, that she has been careless about the last act like some idle poet. But after all some "last" was inevitable, just as to the berries of a tree and the fruits of the earth there comes in the fulness of time a period of decay and fall.


there is a quiet, pure, and cultivated life which produces a calm and gentle old age,


The great affairs of life are not performed by physical strength, or activity, or nimbleness of body, but by deliberation, character, expression of opinion.


For of course rashness is the note of youth, prudence of old age.


no one is so old as to think that he may not live a year.


I now MISS THE BODILY STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN (for that was the second point as to the disadvantages of old age) any more than as a young man I missed the strength of a bull or an elephant. You should use what you have, and whatever you may chance to be doing, do it with all your might.


For nothing gives you uneasiness which you do not miss.


it was a wretched old age that had to defend itself by speech. Neither white hairs nor wrinkles can at once claim influence in themselves: it is the honourable conduct of earlier days that is rewarded by possessing influence at the last.


"The Athenians know what is right, but will not do it."


For can there be anything more absurd than to seek more journey money, the less there remains of the journey?


"An old man has nothing even to hope." Ah, but it is just there that he is in a better position than a young man, since what the latter only hopes he has obtained. The one wishes to live long; the other has lived long.


nothing seems even long in which there is any "last," for when that arrives, then all the past has slipped away—only that remains to which you have attained by virtue and righteous actions.


## Professor Borges: A Course on English Literature, Jorge Luis Borges


Here’s a fairly simple kenning: “the swan of the beer of the dead,” which, when we first see it, we don’t now how to interpret. So, if we break it down, we see that “beer of the dead” means blood, and “swan of the blood” means the bird of death, the raven, so we see that “swan of the beer of the dead” simply means “raven.” And in Scandinavia, whole poems were written like this and with increasing complexity. But this did not happen in England. The metaphors remained in the first degree, without going any further.

But this did not happen in England. The metaphors remained in the first degree, without going any further. As for the use of alliteration, it is interesting to note that a verse is considered alliterative even if it contains stressed words beginning with different vowels. If a verse contains a word with the vowel a, another with , and another with i, they are alliterated. In fact, we cannot know exactly how the vowels were pronounced in Anglo-Saxon. Undoubtedly, Old English had a much more open sound and was more voiced than English is now. Now, in English, consonants serve as the high points of the syllables. On the contrary, Anglo-Saxon or Old English—these words are synonymous—was highly vocalic.9 Besides this, the Anglo-Saxon lexicon was completely Germanic. Before the Norman Conquest, the only other significant influence was the introduction of about five hundred words from Latin. These words were, for the most part, religious, or, if not religious, they named concepts that had not previously existed among those peoples.


In the Odyssey and the Iliad, we see that the bloody and bellicose events are the most paramount. The poet of Beowulf was interested in hospitality, manners, gift-giving, and minstrels more than in military feats; in other words, he was interested in what we would now call “social life.” All of these things were valued at that time and must have been quite appealing


In the Odyssey and the Iliad, we see that the bloody and bellicose events are the most paramount. The poet of Beowulf was interested in hospitality, manners, gift-giving, and minstrels more than in military feats; in other words, he was interested in what we would now call “social life.” All of these things were valued at that time and must have been quite appealing to the Saxons, who lived in a violent era and in inhospitable lands. Europe was colder then. We know this because research has shown that the animals who lived at that time in the south of Europe now live in the north.


Germanic custom. Ships containing the skeletons of men and animals have been found at the bottom of the sea.


in French as bague, meaning “ring.”


The word burh or burg is a word you know, and it means “castle” and has remained in the names of many cities: Edinburgh, “castle of Edin”; Strasbourg, Gothenburg—in the south of Sweden—and the Castilian city of Burgos, which is a Visigoth name. Then we have words like “bourgeois,” someone who lives in a city, and “bourgeoisie.”


The Vikings were perhaps the most extraordinary of all the Germanic peoples of the Middle Ages. They were the best sailors of their time. They had ships, which they called “longships,” that had a dragon, the head of a dragon, on the prow.


the day of the week “Thursday,” which in Saxon is thunresdæg, and contains the Norse name for Thor. But let’s return to the Vikings.


The Homeric Greeks said “the color of wine.” But we don’t know what color wine was for the Greeks; they don’t talk about colors, either. On the other hand, Celtic poetry that is contemporaneous or prior to Germanic poetry, contains an abundance of colors—it’s full of colors.


During the last decade of the tenth century, an event took place in England that had only relative military importance, but it had great relevance for the history of English literature, for out of it came the ballad of “The Battle of Maldon,” which tells of a defeat rather than a victory.


And Caedmon predicted the hour of his death, and he was so certain of it and his posthumous fate that just before this hour, he was asleep rather than in prayer.


Walt Whitman, who speaks about himself in his poems, saying: “Walt Whitman, un cosmos, hijo de Manhattan, turbulento, sensual, paternal, comiendo, bebiendo, sebrando.”


“elegy” really means a poem written to lament someone’s death. However, those poems are called “elegies” not because they lament a death but rather because of their melancholic tone.


England—so important in the history of the world—we see that it is a small island torn off the western- and northern-most reaches of Europe. What I mean is that if you showed a globe to a person who was ignorant of history, this person would never think that such a slip of an island torn by the sea—that slip of an island, penetrated by the sea on all sides—would become the

What I mean is that if you showed a globe to a person who was ignorant of history, this person would never think that such a slip of an island torn by the sea—that slip of an island, penetrated by the sea on all sides—would become the center of an empire. But that’s just what happened.


the sea symbolizes life with its storms and perils, and that an affinity with the sea means an affinity with life. We should not forget that people in the Middle Ages possessed the ability to read a poem on two different levels.


the sea symbolizes life with its storms and perils, and that an affinity with the sea means an affinity with life. We should not forget that people in the Middle Ages possessed the ability to read a poem on two different levels. In other words, those who read this poem thought about the sea, about the seafarer, and they also thought that the sea could be an allegory or a symbol for life.


We must not assume, then, that we are necessarily more complex than the men of the Middle Ages, who were men well versed in theology and theological subtleties. We have surely gained a lot, but it is also possible that we have lost something.


I don’t think there were literary schools at that time. I think they wrote these verses because they felt them, and that they didn’t know they were doing something so extraordinary:


“Þæs ofereode, þisses swa mæg.” “That passed, so too shall this,”


Throughout the Middle Ages, the idea held sway that God had written two books. One of these books, needless to say, was sacred scripture—the Bible—dictated to various people at various times by the Holy Spirit. The other book was the Universe, and all its creatures. It was said repeatedly that the duty of every Christian was to study both books, the holy book and the other enigmatic book, the Universe.


Amazingly enough, the panther is a symbol of Christ.


it has only one enemy: the dragon. Thus, the dragon becomes the symbol of the devil.


masculine “moon” (“el luna”), masculine “salt” (“el sal”), masculine “star” (“el estrella”). Now, it is assumed that the masculine “moon” belongs to a very ancient era, an era of matriarchy, an era when women were more important than men. Women ruled over the family, and so the brighter light—the sun—was considered feminine, and in Norse mythology we have, analogously, a goddess of the sun and a god of the moon.


(In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche compares the sun to a tomcat walking on a carpet of stars. But he does not say “eine Katze,” which could also be a she-cat, but rather “ein Kater,” a tomcat, a male. And he thought of the moon as a monk, not a nun, who gazes enviously at Earth.)


Now, what was it that brought about this simplification, that made contemporary English a much simpler language, grammatically, though much richer in vocabulary than Old English? It is the fact that the Vikings, Danes, and Norwegians settled in the north and the center of England. Now, Old Norse was similar to English. The Saxons had to communicate with the Norsemen, who had become their neighbors, and very soon, the Saxons began to mingle with the Norsemen, who were fewer in number. The Norse race blended with the Saxon race. They had to understand each other, so in order to do so, and as the vocabulary was already so similar, a kind of lingua franca emerged, and English became simpler.


For example, we have “knife.” Why is there a k? Because in Old English this was pronounced, and it has remained like some sort of lost fossil.17 And then we also have the word “knight” in contemporary English. This seems absurd, but it is because in Anglo-Saxon the word cniht meant “servant” or “attendant.” That is, [the initial c] was pronounced.


Then we have two centuries, and during these two centuries it is as if English literature were taking place underground, because French was spoken in court, the clergy spoke Latin, and the people spoke Saxon (four Saxon dialects that were also intermingled with Danish). And one must wait from the year 1066 to the fourteenth century for English literature—which had carried on in a crude, clumsy way, which had continued on like an underground river—to reemerge. And then we have the great names of Chaucer, Langland, and then we have a language, English, that has been deeply permeated by French, to such an extent that, yes, indeed, currently there are more Latin than Germanic words in the English dictionary.


But the Germanic words are the essential ones, they are the words that correspond to fire, metals, man, trees. On the contrary, all the words of culture come from Latin. And here we conclude the


Only a few days have passed since last Friday, but for our studies, it is as if many more had gone by. We are going to leave the eleventh century, take a leap, and land straight in the eighteenth century.


Then they started making dictionaries. The first were Italian and French. In England, the first dictionary was written by an Italian, and called A Worlde of Wordes.6 Next came an etymological dictionary, which attempted


One day, one of his friends told him that the French Academy, with its forty members, had spent forty years creating a dictionary of the French language. And Johnson, who was a staunch nationalist, answered, “Forty Frenchmen to one Englishmen: the correct proportion.”


The poet should not deal with the individual but rather with the generic, for the poet is writing for posterity. He says that the poet must not concern himself with what is local, with what belongs to one class, one region, one nation. For since poetry has that lofty mission to be eternal, the poet should worry not about problems—Johnson did not use the word “problem,” for at that time that word was used specifically for mathematics—not about the concerns of his era, but rather should seek out the eternal, the eternal passions of man, as well as subjects such as the brevity of human life, the vicissitudes of destiny, the hopes we have for immortality, sins, virtues, etcetera.

And, according to one version of this legend—please forgive me this digression, but the story is beautiful—the prince, the driver, and the four characters he sees—the old man,

The philosopher answers that solitude has not allowed him to let go of the images of the city, its sins and its pleasures. That before, when he had all those pleasures within reach, he could gratify himself and then think about other things. But now, living in solitude, the only thing he does is think about the city and the pleasures he has renounced.

Macaulay says that the preeminence of Homer as an epic poet, of Shakespeare as a dramatic poet, of Demosthenes as an orator, and of Cervantes as a novelist is no less indisputable than the preeminence of Boswell as a biographer.


But he knew that everything would be tolerated because he was an important figure.


The Scot tends to be—perhaps as a result of all their theological discussions—much more intellectual, more rational. Englishmen are impulsive; they don’t need theories for their behavior. On the contrary, Scots tend to be thinkers and reasoners. Anyway, there are many differences.


There is a Hindu school of philosophy that says that we are not the actors in our lives, but rather the spectators, and this is illustrated using the metaphor of a dancer. These days, maybe it would be better to say an actor. A spectator sees a dancer or an actor, or, if you prefer, reads a novel, and ends up identifying with one of the characters who is there in front of him. This is what those Hindu thinkers


That is why people say Great Britain, to distinguish it from small Britain, or Brittany,


That is why people say Great Britain, to distinguish it from small Britain, or Brittany, in France. And in France they call that region of the country where the Breton language is spoken Bretagne; the language was thought to be like a patois for a long time, only because the French did not understand either language, so they assumed they were similar, which is part of a deep ideology.


I don’t know if I told you that long ago in Ireland, one had to study for ten years to have a literary career. One had to pass ten examinations. At first one could use only simple meters—let’s say, the hendecasyllable—and could write only about ten different subjects. Then, once these exams were finished—which were given orally in a dark room—they gave the subject and the meter the poet was supposed to use, and they brought him food. Two or three days later, they would question the poet, then allow him to use other subjects and other meters. After ten years, the poet reached the highest grade, but to get there, he had to have a complete knowledge of history, mythology, law, medicine—which was understood as magic in those days—and he received a pension from


I think it is Emerson who recounts that he paid him a visit and made an observation, and Wordsworth refuted him immediately—as was his habit, because no matter what anyone said, he would assert the opposite—and ten minutes or a quarter of an hour later, Wordsworth expressed that same opinion that he had found absurd.


Wordsworth brings to bear here his psychological theory of the origins of poetry. He says that poetry comes from emotion recollected in tranquility.


One of a writer’s most important works—perhaps the most important of all—is the image he leaves of himself in the memory of men, above and beyond the pages he has written.

It is the imperfections of life that are lovable. And when the writer sends a dart of the true word, it hurts.


And your own meaning is that you're there. We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget that the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what it's all about.


## The Story of Utopias, Lewis Mumford


If the world in which men live were the world as it is known to the physical geographer, we should have a pretty simple time of it.


An idea is a solid fact, a theory is a solid fact, a superstition is a solid fact as long as people continue to regulate their actions in terms of the idea, theory, or superstition; and it is nonetheless solid because it is conveyed as an image or a breath of sound.


People who will not venture out into the open sea pay the penalty of never having looked into the bright eyes of danger; and at best they know but half of life. What such folk might call the good life is simply not good enough. We cannot be satisfied with a segment of existence, no matter how safely we may be adjusted to it, when with a little effort we can trace the complete circle.


Anatole France says: "Without the Utopians of other times, men would still live in caves, miserable and naked. It was Utopians who traced the lines of the first city. . . . Out of generous dreams come beneficial realities. Utopia is the principle of all progress, and the essay into a better future."

Heartlessness is a grave human fault and is unforgivable when combined with profligacy, greed, sloth, and disorderliness; but when combined with boundless energy and a rigid sense of order and public decency, heartlessness takes on a different character altogether. It becomes a divine attribute.


‘As easily as a dog squats’ and ‘There are more ways than one of killing a cat’ and ‘You mind your own business, I’ll mind mine’ and ‘I’ll see that it gets done on the Greek Kalends’ (which, of course, means never) and ‘The knee is nearer than the shin’ (which means that one’s first concern is with matters that affect one personally). And if anyone tried to contradict him on a point of literary scholarship, he used to say: ‘A radish may know no Greek, but I do’. And whenever he was encouraging anyone to bear an unpleasant condition patiently he always used to say: ‘Let us content ourselves with this Cato’.

‘Do you know the Jewish version of Deucalion’s Flood? The Jewish Deucalion was called Noah, and he had three married sons who, when the Flood subsided, repeopled the earth. The eldest was Shem, the middle one was Ham, and the youngest was Japhet. Ham was punished for laughing at his father when he accidentally got drunk and threw off all his clothes, by being fated to serve the other two, who behaved with greater decency. Ham is the ancestor of all the African peoples. Japhet is the ancestor of the Greeks and Italians, and Shem the ancestor of the Jews, Syrians, Phoenicians, Arabians, Edomites, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and the like. There is an ancient prophetic saying that if Shem and Japhet ever live under the same roof there will be endless bickering at the fireside, at the table, and in the bed-chamber.

remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labours of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving. I am strongly drawn to the simple life and am often oppressed by the feeling that I am engrossing an unnecessary amount of the labour of my fellowmen. I regard class differences as contrary to justice and, in the last resort, based on force. I also consider that plain living is good for everybody, physically and mentally.


In human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity.

And yet everybody has certain ideals which determine the direction of his endeavours and his judgments.

## The Unfolding Of Language, Guy Deutscher


‘this marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’.


In themselves, these configurations of the mouth – p, f, b, v, t, d, k, g, sh, a, e and so on – amount to nothing more than a few haphazard spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to express, no power to explain. But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine, let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable ennui of existence (‘not tonight, Josephine’) to unravelling the fundamental order of the universe


Ancient languages such as Sanskrit, Greek and Gothic flaunted not just highly complex case systems on nouns, but even more complex systems of endings on verbs, which were used to express a range of intricate nuances of meaning. But once again, most of these structures did not survive the passing of time, and fell apart in the modern descendants. It seemed that the deeper linguists dug into history, the more impressive was the make-up of words they encountered, but when they followed the movement of languages through time, the only processes that could be discerned were disintegration and collapse.


the signs, then, seemed to point to some Golden Age lying somewhere in the twilight of prehistory ( just before records began), when languages were graced with perfectly formed structures, especially with elaborate arrays of endings on words. But at some subsequent stage, and for some unknown reason, the forces of destruction were unleashed on the languages and began battering the carefully crafted edifices, wearing away all those endings. So, strangely enough, what linguists were uncovering only seemed to confirm the gist of the biblical account: God gave Adam a perfect language some 6,000 years ago, and since then, we have just been messing it up.

One of the most original theories was surely that of Frenchman Jean-Pierre Brisset, who in 1900 demonstrated how human language (that is to say, French) developed directly from the croaking of frogs. One day, as Brisset was observing frogs in a pond, one of them looked him straight in the eye and croaked ‘coac’. After some deliberation, Brisset realized that what the frog was saying was simply an abbreviated version of the question ‘quoi que tu dis?’ He thus proceeded to derive the whole of language from permutations and combinations of ‘coac coac’.16

The trainers ignored the baby because they thought he was still too young to learn, but unbeknownst to them, Kanzi was taking in more than his mother ever did, and as he grew up he went on to develop cognitive and communicative skills far surpassing any other ape before. As an adult, he is reported to be able to use over 200 different symbols, and to understand as many as 500 spoken words and even some very simple sentences.


a language with only words, and no structure to prop them up, would be a poor instrument of communication. Words may be the bricks in the language edifice, but when we want to convey subtle thoughts, involving intricate relations between different concepts, we need to combine words into proper sentences.


‘natural’ is very much a matter of geography: what is perfectly natural to a Turk does not seem even remotely natural to an English speaker.

fact, the multi-tier organization of the sentence is one of the most fundamental design-features of language. Even though on the surface a sentence might seem like just a string of words in linear succession, underneath the floorboards there is a lot going on, with words hierarchically organized on different tiers.


The quarrelsome seal that was eyeing a disenchanted but rather attractive fish that was jumping in and out of the icy water has picked a fight with a phlegmatic walrus that was innocently passing by. The fourth sentence, running to a total of thirty-five words, is pretty complex. And yet, for a speaker of English, this sentence is immediately comprehensible, because its complexity is mitigated by the hierarchy of command.


Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew. The architecture of the Semitic verb is one of the most imposing edifices to be seen anywhere in the world’s languages, but it is founded on a concept of the sparest design: a root which consists of only consonants.

The teacher claimed it was so plain, I only had to use my brain. She said the past of throw was threw, The past of grow – of course – was grew, So flew must be the past of fly, And now, my boy, your turn to try. But when I trew, I had no clue, If mow was mew Like know and knew (Or is it knowed Like snow and snowed?) The teacher frowned at me and said The past of feed was – plainly – fed. Fed up, I knew then what I ned: I took a break, and out I snoke, She shook and quook (or quaked? or quoke?) With raging anger out she broke: Your ignorance you want to hide? Tell me the past form of collide! But how on earth should I decide If it’s collid (Like hide and hid), Or else – from all that I surmose, The past of rise was simply rose, And that of ride was surely rode, So of collide must be collode? Oh damn these English verbs, I thought The whole thing absolutely stought! Of English I have had enough, These verbs of yours are far too tough. Bolt upright in my chair I sat, And said to her ‘that’s that’ – I quat.


A stone, for instance, may be an ‘it’ in English, but it is most definitely a ‘he’ in German, Norwegian, Polish, Albanian, Russian or Lithuanian, and unquestionably a ‘she’ in French, Italian, Irish or Hebrew. Classical Greek and Akkadian (the language of Ancient Babylon and Assyria) came up with something even better, since in these languages, a stone was a ‘he’ or ‘she’ depending on one’s fancy.


Well, the Polychronicon wasn’t really concerned with cutlery. At that time, ‘spoon’ just meant a thin piece of wood, a chip, or a splinter.


One only need compare a short phrase from the four biblical passages above to appreciate that no area of English stood still for very long: ∼ 1000: me ofthingth(displeases) sothlice(soothly) thæt(that) ic(I) hi(them) worhte(made) ∼ 1400: forsothe it othenkith(displeases) me to haue maad hem (them) ∼ 1600: for it repenteth me that I haue made them ∼ 2000: because I regret having made them


by the sixteenth century, ‘I’ came to be pronounced {ay}. And by the eighteenth century, {ay} changed further into the modern pronunciation {eye}.


I take it you already know6 Of tough and bough and cough and dough? Others may stumble, but not you, On hiccough, thorough, lough, and through? Well done! And now you wish perhaps, To learn of less familiar traps? Beware of heard, a dreadful word That looks like beard and sounds like bird. And dead – it’s said like bed, not bead – For goodness sake, don’t call it ‘deed’. Watch out for meat and great and threat (They rhyme with suite and straight and debt): A moth is not a moth in mother, Nor both in bother, broth in brother. And here is not a match for there Nor dear and fear for bear and pear. And then there’s dose and rose and lose – Just look them up – and goose and choose, And cork and work and card and ward, And font and front, and word and sword, And do and go, and thwart and cart – Come! Come! I’ve hardly made a start! (From the Manchester Guardian, 1954)


it is unfair to say that English spelling is not an accurate rendering of speech. It is – it’s only that it renders the speech of the sixteenth century.


For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.


The simple truth is that all languages change, all the time – the only static languages are dead ones.


Just imagine two groups living in two neighbouring villages, speaking similar varieties of one language. With the passing of time, their language undergoes constant transformations, but as long as the two communities remain in close contact, their varieties will change in tandem: innovations in one village will soon spread to the other, because of the need to communicate. Now suppose that one of the groups wanders off in search of better land, and loses all contact with the speakers of the other village. The language of the two groups will then start wandering in different directions, because there will be nothing to maintain the changes in tandem. Eventually, their varieties will have strayed so far apart that they will no longer be mutually intelligible, and so turn into different languages.


Even if some changes in language come about in order to adapt to changing realities, these constitute only a minor part of the overall transformations that languages undergo. The main bulk of changes must stem from entirely different reasons. There is a close runner-up in the list of ‘obvious’ explanations for why language changes so much, and that is the issue of contact.


It seems that languages need neither nudging from the Joneses nor the gadgetry of ploughs in order to be transformed, for they keep changing, even without the slightest provocation, and even in spite of people’s best intentions.


It seems that languages need neither nudging from the Joneses nor the gadgetry of ploughs in order to be transformed, for they keep changing, even without the slightest provocation, and even in spite of people’s best intentions. But if all these external reasons fail to explain the changes, then there must be something in language itself which makes it so unsteady. There must be something inherently unstable in the very way in which we communicate, some element of volatility which drives language into a state of inner restlessness, and gives it itchy feet. But what? The


Changes in language come about in a rather similar fashion, through the accumulation of unintended actions. These actions must stem from entirely selfish motives, not from


the motives for change can be encapsulated in the triad economy, expressiveness and analogy.


the motives for change can be encapsulated in the triad economy, expressiveness and analogy. Economy refers to the tendency to save effort, and is behind the short-cuts speakers often take in pronunciation. As we shall see in the following chapter, when these short-cuts accumulate, they can create new sounds, just like the new footpath cutting through the field. Expressiveness relates to speakers’ attempts to achieve greater effect for their utterances and extend their range of meaning.


analogy, is shorthand for the mind’s craving for order, the instinctive need of speakers to find regularity in language.


the verb ‘resent’ simply had a different meaning, and could do the work of our modern ‘appreciate’ or ‘feel grateful for’ – exactly the opposite of its sense today.


‘fast’, which started off meaning something like ‘secure’, or ‘not moving at all’, later developed the contrary sense ‘moving quickly’.


Shakespeare may have used ‘like’ in the older sense (‘the musician likes me not’), but in fact, he also uses ‘like’ in the modern – flipped – meaning. In Othello, for instance, the musicians are told: ‘the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.’


as the seventeenth century drew to a close, the positive sense of ‘resent’ gradually faded away. While speakers at the time would hardly have noticed it, nearly four centuries on this creates the appearance of a complete U-turn.


‘The decay of the French language,’ he declared, ‘started in 1789,’ to which Hugo famously retorted: ‘À quelle heure, s’il vous plaît?’


The forces of destruction almost seem to leap out of the pages of practically any language’s history, but the contrary processes, the productive forces of renewal and creation, are much more difficult to spot


Just and jurisdiction, for instance, both go back to the Latin root jus ‘justice’, but in justus ‘just’, the s remained unaltered, whereas in jurisdictio ‘administration of justice’, the s of the genitive case jusis was caught between two vowels, so it changed to juris. The same applies to rustic and rural, both from the noun rus ‘country’.)


Italian caldo means not ‘cold’ but ‘hot’?


The changes at the top (g → k, d → t, b → p) also represent a kind of weakening, but here effort is spared for the vocal cords. The sounds g, d and b are called ‘voiced’ consonants, because when we produce them, the vocal cords start vibrating at the same time as the air is released from its temporary blockage, or just a split second before. The sounds k, t and p are called ‘voiceless’ consonants, because they are produced without the additional vibration of the vocal cords, but with the tongue or lips blocking the air in exactly the same way as in g, d and b. (You can check out the difference by pronouncing each of the pairs while whispering. You will hear that the distinction between the voiced and voiceless sounds almost disappears.) Of course, vibrating the vocal cords is an additional effort that can sometimes be spared, and so a voiced g turned into a voiceless k, and similarly, d turned to t, and b to p.


Grimm’s law explains why the relation between English words and their cognates in non-Germanic Indo-European languages is not always immediately apparent to the untrained eye. English cold, for instance, is related to Italian gelato ‘frozen’ rather than to its false friend caldo ‘hot’. And there are many other such surprising ‘twins’, cognates such as grain and corn, which may look rather different to the casual observer, but nevertheless come via different routes from exactly the same Proto-Indo-European root.


Old English hlaf-weard ‘loaf-ward(en)’ or ‘bread keeper’. Hlaf-weard, with its two words and three syllables, was shortened to hlaford, thence to laferd, then lowerd, until it finally ended up as our impoverished modern lord, with just one halfpenny-syllable to his name.


persica malus ‘Persian apple’, with its five juicy vowels and seven luscious consonants. It ended up in French as a word of just one vowel and two consonants: first, the whole second word was dropped altogether, leaving persica. Then the vowel i disappeared to give persca, which was further shortened to pesca, then to pesche, and finally pêche, ending up on English palates as a rather shrivelled ‘peach’. In fact, when it comes to shedding syllables, French is a prime example.


The prehistoric ancestor, Proto-Indo-European, had eight distinct cases, but only Sanskrit retained the full system, whereas in all the other daughter languages, erosion had started taking its toll even before the earliest records began.


The verb ‘make’ is one example, since its irregular past tense ‘made’ is only a fairly recent mishap. In the thirteenth century, ‘make’ was still a well-behaved regular verb, and had a past tense with the ending -ed. But clearly, the form ‘maked’ felt too broad in the beam, and so speakers stopped bothering with pronouncing the bit in the middle.


Alas, it seems that meaning is just as prone to attrition as sounds. And ironically, the decay in meaning seems to be set off not by any indolent desire to save effort, but rather by almost the precise opposite: the wish to enhance expressiveness.


‘Not’ is thus a prime example of both material and social decline. It started as a paunchy ne-a-wiht ‘nothing whatsoever’, a word rich in length and weighty in meaning, but its form was reduced to not (or even just n’t), and its meaning eroded to the plainest of no’s.


The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs, and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong, indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.


most European languages (except a handful like Basque, Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian) were related to one another, and even to some languages of India and Persia, through one common prehistoric ancestor


Many people know that the existence and location of Neptune were hypothesized by the mathematician John Couch Adams in 1843, on the basis of peculiarities in the movement of another planet, Uranus. Following his predictions of where this planet should be found, astronomers eventually managed to spot the elusive Neptune in the sky. Fewer people know of an equally extraordinary coup in the study of language, made three decades later by a Swiss whizz-kid called Ferdinand de Saussure,31 probably the cleverest of linguists before or since.


At the implausible age of twenty-one,


Hittite was so much older than the other attested Indo-European languages (some of its texts dated from the seventeenth century BC) that it still contained a certain consonant, transcribed as , which – lo and behold – appeared in the very places where Saussure had expected one of the rogue sounds to turn up. Take the root ‘protect’, for instance, which appeared as pās in the other languages, but which according to Saussure must earlier have been paXs (and ultimately have started out as a regular peXs). In the Hittite texts, this root showed up with an additional consonant precisely where Saussure expected an X – it was written pas. What Saussure had deduced purely on the basis of formal correspondences between the other Indo-European languages was dug up more than thirty years later from the Anatolian earth, scratched on clay.


In prehistoric times, according to Schleicher, a nation was busy constructing its language, and ‘only when a nation has perfected its language, may it make its entrance into history’. But upon entering the stage of history a radical change of direction has to take place, since from now on the energy of a people is invested in history-making instead. So once history, ‘that enemy of language’, gets under

But upon entering the stage of history a radical change of direction has to take place, since from now on the energy of a people is invested in history-making instead. So once history, ‘that enemy of language’, gets under way, language begins to fall apart and decay.


Yeats’s closing lines from his poem ‘He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven’: ‘I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.’


meta-phora is Greek for ‘carry across’ (meta = ‘across’, phor = ‘carry’). Or to use the Latin equivalent, meta-phor just means trans-fer.


In India there is a sect of Jainist monks called the Shvetambara, who always carry a broom and sweep the ground before them as they walk, lest they accidentally tread on some insects and squash them. If one were to show the same consideration towards metaphors in language, one would require much more than a broom. One would need to levitate, or take a vow of eternal silence, for it transpires that even the most tedious prose is teeming with metaphors.


The word ‘thrill’, for example, goes back to an Old English verb thyrlian, which originally meant ‘pierce’ (and incidentally, is related to the word nos-thyrl, ‘nostril’, or ‘nose-hole’).


‘Rival’ comes from Latin rivalis, meaning someone who shares the same river. From there, the word came to mean someone who shares (or competes for) the same mistress (that is, rival in love), and from there, to rival more generally.


‘Sarcastic’ comes from Greek ‘flesh tearing’ (sárx – flesh), and is related to the word sarcophagus (literally ‘flesh eating’).


Today ‘abstract’ may be the fare of philosophers, a word used to refer to concepts that are removed from physical reality. But the origins of ‘abstract’ are much more earthly, as ‘abstract’ comes from a Latin verb which simply meant ‘draw away’ (abstrahere).


The verb ‘understand’ itself may be a brittle old skeleton by now, but its origin is still obvious: under-stand originally must have meant something like ‘step under’, perhaps rather like the image in the phrase ‘get to the bottom of’.


‘Have’ ultimately derives from a Proto-Indo-European root *kap, which meant ‘seize’. The original sense of *kap survives in the Latin root cap ‘seize’, which found its way into English in the borrowed words ‘capture’ (as well as in ‘captive’, ‘caption’, ‘capable’, ‘recipe’, ‘occupy’, and even ‘catch’). The reason why the English home-grown ‘have’ looks so different from its forebear *kap is simply Grimm’s law, the series of sound changes in Germanic mentioned in the previous chapter, in which k was weakened to h, and p to f, thus turning *kap into *haf. So while ‘capture’ and ‘have’ look rather un-identical, they are in fact a pair of separated twins, deriving from the same source, *kap ‘seize’.


Consider some of the simplest words we use to describe spatial relations: prepositions such as in, at, by, from, to, behind, within, through. The examples below should suffice to show that all these spatial terms function just as well in the domain of temporal relations: The list could easily be lengthened, and the correspondences are by no means coincidental. What’s more, if the same experiment were to be repeated with spatial concepts in any other language, the result would be the same, as there is no known language where spatial terms are not also used to describe temporal relations. Language thus demonstrates that long before physicists, common intuition had already spotted the relation between space and time, and the nature of this intuited link is none other than metaphor.

One good example is ‘pointing words’ (or ‘demonstratives’ in linguistic terminology) such as the English ‘that’, which are used to point at an object and single it out.

Bakunin is spot on: the forces that create grammatical structures in language are nothing other than the by-products of destruction.


we call some words ‘content words’ because they have an independent meaning, and we call other words ‘grammatical words’ because they don’t.


Here is a slightly absurd example, which might help to drive the point home.


but originally ‘will’ was an entirely normal verb that simply meant ‘want to’ or ‘desire’.

There’s only so much you can do with a single word. You can spit it out with passion and intone it with gravity, but there’s a limit to the amount of emphasis you can invest in it this way. So what do you do if you want to add more weight? You add more words. You combine them, pile them up into longer phrases.


Old English ufan meant ‘on up’ – it was the locative case of the preposition uf ‘up’. But this little ufan was not considered nearly sturdy enough, so it was reinforced by another preposition, be ‘by’, to give a beefier be-ufan ‘by on up’. But before long, be-ufan was assaulted by the forces of erosion, and ended up as a mere bufan. Naturally, the syllabically-challenged bufan had to be pumped up again, this time by the preposition an ‘on’, to give an-bufan ‘on by on up’. Later on, anbufan was ground down by erosion, and – to cut a long story short – ended up as the modest above. But it seems that a mere above doesn’t soar nearly high enough nowadays, so we sometimes feel the need to reinforce it with ‘up’, to give up above – literally ‘up on by on up’.


What makes the Semitic verbal architecture so special is not so much the sheer bulk of the templates, but rather the remarkable idea behind their design, the system of tri-consonantal roots and prefabricated vowel templates.

For if it was not invented, how could people ever have stumbled across such an unusual idea?

For if it was not invented, how could people ever have stumbled across such an unusual idea? And yet, there is an alternative explanation. We do not have to call on a deus ex machina to account for the origin of designs such as the Semitic verbal system, nor is there any need to discern the guiding hand of an architect in their construction. The following pages will try to show that it is within our grasp to understand how abstract linguistic designs could have arisen of their own accord. But if there is to be any chance of success in this enterprise, then we cannot pin all our hopes on erosion alone. We have to call on another essential element, one which the previous chapters have rather neglected. Chapter 2 mentioned a triad of motives for language’s inner restlessness: economy, expressiveness and analogy. So far, however, only the first two of these motives have received much attention: economy, which causes the erosion in sounds, and expressiveness, which results in the inflationary erosion in meaning and drives the flow of metaphors from the concrete to the abstract. The role of analogy was acknowledged only summarily (in Chapter 4), as the cognitive mechanism behind our ability to find similarities between different domains, that is, our capacity for metaphorical thinking. Nevertheless, to understand how abstract designs can emerge in language, what will prove critical is exactly this overlooked third part of the triad, analogy, or the mind’s craving for order. This


‘Funes the Memorious’, the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges tells of a man called Funes, who lost consciousness when he was thrown off a horse and after regaining it found that he couldn’t forget anything he had ever seen or heard.


To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract.


Borges understood that the ability to pick out patterns, to draw analogies between unequal yet similar things, in short, to ‘forget a difference’, is at the very core of our intelligence.


‘Cherry’ comes from Old Northern French cherise, a word which happened to end with an s sound although it wasn’t plural – just like ‘cheese’ today. In the fourteenth century, some speakers falsely assumed that cherise was an instance of the common pattern NOUN+s → PLURAL, so they applied this pattern in reverse, and produced the singular form ‘cherry’. This must initially have sounded just as ‘wrong’ to educated speakers as ‘one chee’ would to us today.


The oldest known member of the language family is Akkadian, which is attested from around 2500 BC, and is thus one of the earliest written languages of all. (Only Sumerian and Ancient Egyptian can beat that record.) Akkadian


after 2000 BC, Akkadian diverged into two main varieties, Babylonian in the south of Mesopotamia and Assyrian in the north, both of which were to become the languages of powerful empires. Speakers of Akkadian (both Babylonian and Assyrian) dominated the political and cultural horizon of the Near East up until the sixth century BC.


More stable than the power of the sword, however, was the cultural hegemony of Mesopotamia over the whole region.

This short missive was written in the twenty-third century BC, and shows that on some issues, little has changed in more than 4,000 years: A letter from the Old Akkadian period, twenty-third century BC The other languages of the Semitic family are attested from a much later period. The next in line is the Canaanite branch of Semitic, which includes Hebrew and other closely related varieties such as Phoenician, Moabite and Ammonite. Some time in the second millennium BC, the Canaanites developed the first ever writing system for the common man, the alphabet. (Which group among them was the first to do so is still a moot point.) Hebrew was spoken by the Judeans and Israelites until the last few centuries BC, when it was displaced by Aramaic, but it survived as the religious and literary language of the Jews, and was revived in the twentieth century as the language of modern Israel. Phoenician was the language of the seafaring people of the Lebanese coastal cities Tyre, Sidon and Byblos. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Phoenicians is responsible, among other things, for the exportation of the Canaanite alphabet to the Greeks, and for the word ‘Bible’. (The Greeks called papyrus-paper ‘Byblos’, because that was the city from which they imported this commodity. The word then assumed the sense of ‘book’, and thence ‘The Book’.) The Phoenicians also founded various trading colonies in Europe and North Africa, one of which was Carthage (Kart-hadasht or ‘Newtown’ in the Punic dialect of Phoenician). Another sibling in the Semitic family, Aramaic, has its roots in today’s Syria. During the first millennium BC, Aramaic speakers spread across a much wider area, so that Aramaic eventually became the street-lingo in Palestine and even in Assyria and Babylon. In the sixth century BC, after the fall of Babylon, Aramaic even became the official language of the Achaemenid (Persian) empire. Some parts of the Old Testament, such as the Book of Daniel, are written mostly in Aramaic, and a later dialect, Syriac, became the vehicle of important Christian literature and exegesis. Varieties

Arabic has weakened the original Semitic p’s into f’s, following a well-trodden path which has also been traversed by the Germanic languages (Grimm’s law from Chapter 3). This is why the equivalent to the Akkadian root p-t-l appears in Arabic as f-t-l. What makes Arabic somewhat unusual, however, is the thoroughness of the change. Absolutely all the p’s in the language were weakened to f’s – no p was left unturned – so that Arabic is one of the few languages in the world which lacks the sound p altogether.

There is a story of an Englishman sitting in a restaurant in northern France, struggling with some of the finer points of the menu. The attentive waiter spots his difficulty, and asks politely: ‘Monsieur est étranger?’7 The Englishman looks shocked, and replies, with some dignity: ‘Étranger? Mais non, je suis Anglais!’


‘Red’, for instance, sometimes comes from ‘blood’, as in the Semitic languages, where dam ‘blood’ is the source of adam ‘red’ (and hence, incidentally, via the Hebrew word for ‘red dust’, the name of Adam,17 ‘man’).


during his state visit to Moscow,27 Fidel Castro is shown around the capital by Leonid Brezhnev. First of all, Castro is invited for a beer, which he downs in one go, and praises heartily. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘it was provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ Then Castro is chauffeured around the city, and is rather taken by the limo. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘these cars are provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ Later on, they visit an exhibition of fine crystal, and Castro duly waxes lyrical. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘the crystal is provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ ‘They must be very good friends,’ says Castro. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘they must.’


In linguistic jargon, however, ‘gender’ has nothing to do with sex, and can refer to any kind of classification that a language imposes on nouns.


They are in fact representatives of two vast opposing camps, into which the world’s languages seem to be divided roughly half and half. Arabic, Thai and Mixtec (an American-Indian language spoken in Mexico), just to take a handful of examples, arrange their elements more or less like English, whereas Japanese, Greenlandic Inuktitut (spoken by the 40,000 Inuit in Greenland) and Kannada (a Dravidian language spoken by 40 million people in southern India) arrange the elements roughly as in Turkish. This means that English tongues and minds can easily get into a terrible twist when trying to learn Turkish, but the Japanese, who have a reputation for struggling with English, often astound teachers of Turkish by the ease and speed with which they learn that language, even though there is no family relation between Turkish and Japanese whatsoever – Turkish and Japanese are as far removed from each other as either of them is from English.


Among the languages of the world which have gender distinctions, there seem to be only a few which have a consistent or nearly consistent logical classification. Tamil is an example of an almost entirely consistent system,


Semitic is family with longest history: the only serious contestant to the length of attested history is ancient Egyptian, whose written records start around 3000 BC, and whose later descendant, Coptic, was spoken until around AD 1500.


## On the Shortness of Life, Seneca

‘It is a small part of life we really live.’ Indeed, all the rest is not life but merely time. Vices

X cultivates Y and Y cultivates Z – no one bothers about himself.


Men do not let anyone seize their estates, and if there is the slightest dispute about their boundaries they rush to stones and arms; but they allow others to encroach on their lives – why, they themselves even invite in those who will take over their lives.


People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.


Consider also the diseases which we have brought on ourselves, and the time too which has been unused. You will find that you have fewer years than you reckon.


Call to mind when you ever had a fixed purpose; how few days have passed as you had planned; when you were ever at your own disposal; when your face wore its natural expression; when your mind was undisturbed; what work you have achieved in such a long life; how many have plundered your life when you were unaware of your losses; how much you have lost through groundless sorrow, foolish joy, greedy desire, the seductions of society; how little of your own was left to you.


how much you have lost through groundless sorrow, foolish joy, greedy desire, the seductions of society; how little of your own was left to you.


You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.


Aren’t you ashamed to keep for yourself just the remnants of your life, and to devote to wisdom only that time which cannot be spent on any business?


He had neither peace in prosperity nor patience in adversity, and how often does he curse that very consulship, which he had praised without ceasing though not without good reason!


You might have known that such premature boldness would result in terrible trouble, both public and private. So he was too late in complaining that


You might have known that such premature boldness would result in terrible trouble, both public and private.


You can give me a list of miserly men, or hot-tempered men who indulge in unjust hatreds or wars: but they are all sinning in a more manly way. It is those who are on a headlong course of gluttony and lust who are stained with dishonour.


who are on a headlong course of gluttony


Living is the least important activity of the preoccupied man; yet there is nothing which is harder to learn.


But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.


All those who call you to themselves draw you away from yourself.


So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For


But nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend their all to stay alive.


And yet it is easy to organize an amount, however small, which is assured; we have to be more careful in preserving what will cease at an unknown point.


Life will follow the path it began to take, and will neither reverse nor check its course. It will cause no commotion to remind you of its swiftness, but glide on quietly. It will not lengthen itself for a king’s command or a people’s favour. As it started out on its first day, so it will run on, nowhere pausing or turning aside.


They keep themselves officiously preoccupied in order to improve their lives; they spend their


lives in organizing their lives. They direct their purposes with an eye to a distant future. But putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future.


So you must match time’s swiftness with your speed in using it, and you must drink quickly as though from a rapid stream that will not always flow.


Old age overtakes them while they are still mentally childish, and they face it unprepared and unarmed. For they have made no provision for it, stumbling upon it suddenly and unawares, and without realizing that it was approaching day by day.


But Fabianus, who was not one of today’s academic philosophers but the true old-fashioned sort, used to say that we must attack the passions by brute force and not by logic; that the enemy’s line must be turned by a strong attack and not by pinpricks;

Still, in order that the people concerned may be censured for their own individual faults, they must be taught and not just given up for lost. Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain. For this last is the one over which Fortune has lost her power, which cannot be brought back to anyone’s control. But this is what preoccupied people lose: for they have no time to look back at their past, and even if they did, it is not pleasant to recall activities they are ashamed of. So


But all the days of the past will come to your call: you can detain and inspect them at your will – something which the preoccupied have no time to do.


just as it is no use pouring any amount of liquid into a container without a bottom to catch and hold it, so it does not matter how much time we are given if there is nowhere for it to settle; it escapes through the cracks and holes of the mind. The


Feeble old men pray for a few more years; they pretend they are younger than they are; they comfort themselves by this deception and fool themselves as eagerly as if they fooled Fate at the same time. But when at last some illness has reminded them of their mortality, how terrified do they die, as if they were not just passing out of life but being dragged out of it.


None of it is frittered away, none of it scattered here and there, none of it committed to fortune, none of it lost through carelessness, none of it wasted on largesse, none of it superfluous: the whole of it, so to speak, is well invested. So, however short, it is fully sufficient, and therefore whenever his last day comes, the wise man will not hesitate to meet death with a firm step.

Since nature allows us to enter into a partnership with every age, why not turn from this brief and transient spell of time and give ourselves wholeheartedly to the past, which is limitless and eternal and can be shared with better men than we?

All the greatest blessings create anxiety, and Fortune is never less to be trusted than when it is fairest.


All the greatest blessings create anxiety, and Fortune is never less to be trusted than when it is fairest. To preserve prosperity we need other prosperity, and to support the prayers which have turned out well we have to make other prayers. Whatever comes our way by chance is unsteady, and the higher it rises the more liable it is to fall. Furthermore, what is doomed to fall delights no one. So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil.


There will always be causes for anxiety, whether due to prosperity or to wretchedness. Life will be driven on through a succession of preoccupations: we shall always


You are winning affection in a job in which it is hard to avoid ill-will; but believe me it is better to understand the balance-sheet of one’s own life than of the corn trade.


So, when you see a man repeatedly wearing the robe of office, or one whose name is often spoken in the Forum, do not envy him: these things are won at the cost of life. In order that one year may be dated from their names they will waste all their own years. Life has left some men struggling at the

too nothing is more harmful than premature treatment.


Anyway, I’ll try my best, not trusting in my cleverness, but because being myself the comforter I can thereby be the most effective comfort.


Everlasting misfortune does have one blessing, that it ends up by toughening those whom it constantly afflicts.


Never have I trusted Fortune, even when she seemed to offer peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me – money, public office, influence – I relegated to a place whence she could claim them back without bothering me. I kept a wide gap between them and me, with the result that she has taken them away, not torn them away. No man has been shattered by the blows of Fortune unless he was first deceived by her favours. Those who loved her gifts as if they were their own for ever, who wanted to be admired on account of them, are laid low and grieve when the false and transient pleasures desert their vain and childish minds, ignorant of every stable pleasure. But


only the most worthless of our possessions should come into the power of another. Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be neither given nor taken away.

‘Where is the need,’ I ask, ‘to compose something to last for ages? Why not stop trying to prevent posterity being silent about you? You were born to die, and a silent funeral is less bothersome. So if you must fill your time, write something in a simple style for your own use and not for publication: less toil is needed if you study only for the day.’


I imagine many people could have achieved wisdom if they had not imagined they had already achieved it, if they had not dissembled about some of their own characteristics and turned a blind eye to others.

even a calm sea will show some ripples, especially when it has subsided following a storm. So what you need is not those more radical remedies which we have now finished with – blocking yourself here, being angry with yourself there, threatening yourself sternly somewhere else – but the final treatment, confidence in yourself and the belief that you are on the right path, and not led astray by the many tracks which cross yours of people who are hopelessly


lost, though some are wandering not far from the true path. But what you are longing for is great and supreme and nearly divine – not to be shaken.


In fact there are innumerable characteristics of the malady, but one effect – dissatisfaction with oneself. This arises from mental instability and from fearful and unfulfilled desires, when men do not dare or do not achieve all they long for, and all they grasp at is hope: they are always unbalanced and fickle, an inevitable consequence of living in suspense. They struggle to gain their prayers by every path, and they teach and force themselves to do dishonourable and difficult things; and when their efforts are unrewarded the fruitless disgrace tortures them, and they regret


not the wickedness but the frustration of their desires. Then they are gripped by repentance for their attempt and fear of trying again, and they are undermined by the restlessness of a mind that can discover no outlet, because they can neither control nor obey their desires, by the dithering of a life that cannot see its way ahead, and by the lethargy of a soul stagnating amid its abandoned hopes. All these afflictions are worse when, through hatred of their toilsome failure, men have retreated into idleness and private studies which are unbearable to a mind aspiring to public service, keen on activity, and restless by

According to legend, it was while lazing in bed and staring at a fly on the ceiling that Descartes, habitually a late riser, conceived of the “X” and “Y” axes that comprise the coordinate grid, now the bane of so many grade-schoolers who lose sleep studying its properties.


But it turns out that the brain is not just sitting there waiting for the next stimulation. Rather, the brain is perpetually and spontaneously active. It is maintaining, interpreting, responding, and predicting.


Amazon, I counted over ninety-five thousand books on time management. You would need to be very skilled at time management to read all of the time management books on Amazon. Assuming the average length of a book is two hundred pages, that’s nineteen million pages of time management material to read. You would have to read about three time management books a day for seventy-two years to get through them all.


Does it seem odd that as the time management industry sells more books, the number of hours we work increases? To quote Bertrand Russell, “can anything more insane be imagined?”


You can only waste time relative to some context or goal. While you are reading this book, you are wasting time relative to your goal of getting to the store before you have to pick up your kids. In fact, from some perspective, you are always wasting time.


Once we correct certain errors in our beliefs about our brains, our overworked society will appear to future generations as ridiculous and appalling.


apes are known to be proficient tool users, but they only seem to use the tools in their immediate vicinity. Chimpanzees often use nearby twigs to lure ants out of a colony. But no chimpanzees have been seen to carry a twig for miles, knowing that they might get hungry later and there might be an ant colony along the way.


So, somehow our brains seem to violate the second law of thermodynamics which states that left unattended, things in general get messy and lose heat. This is called entropy. It’s why your kitchen just gets messier and messier the longer you don’t clean it. However, the old adage that “the dishes don’t do themselves” does not apply to the brain.


Yet we feel obliged to risk our long-term health in order to work extremely hard at jobs we don’t particularly enjoy in order to buy things we don’t particularly want. This is otherwise known as free-market capitalism.


Few people fear being overweight as much as they fear terrorism, even though statistically being obese is much more of a threat to your life than terrorism.


This is called memory consolidation. It is especially important when you are learning new ideas or skills. So the best thing to do after learning new information is to take nap, or at least be idle.


What we do know now is that brain plasticity is possible throughout our lifespan. So it truly is never too late to learn a new instrument, to learn a new language, or to radically change your life: your brain will change, too.


It follows that a lifetime of being super-productive and pointlessly-busy might also decrease the functional connectivity in your default mode network.

One of the best ways to get to know yourself is to find a quiet or comfortably noisy place, stare at the sky, space out for a while and see what the precuneous gets up to.


in males, the prefrontal cortex does not finish maturing until about age twenty-five. I mentioned above that the prefrontal cortex is responsible for skills like decision making, planning, impulsecontrol, and self-reflection—skills that many males under twenty-five tend to lack.


Newton was in fact known for his obsessive work ethic. He could sit in his garden and do nothing because it would never have occurred to Newton that sitting in his garden contemplating was the same thing as wasting time.


A “Newton” is an indispensible unit of measurement that tells you how much force you need to move a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared.


When children enter school, and increasingly even before they enter school, parents fill up their lives with a stream of activities: sports, early exposure music classes, Chinese immersion school, summer camps, volunteer soup kitchen duties, dressage lessons, theater coaching, mathletics, and science workshops. There seems to be a pervasive and deep-seated anxiety among a certain class of parents that their children might actually have time to hang around and be children. Parents are forced to work longer and longer hours, sometimes just to keep the same pay. To replace ourselves we force our children to endure an endless barrage of activities that serve as proxy parents. We do this in order to convince ourselves that we still participate in some meaningful way in our children’s lives.

This, despite the fact that IQs have been rising. After analyzing the data from around three hundred thousand children and adults, Kyng Hee Kim, a researcher at William & Mary, found that this decline in creativity is most pronounced in exactly the age group from which you’d expect the most creativity, kindergarten through sixth grade.

Then abruptly terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.


For example, research indicates that young people who send text messages extremely often tend to score lower on tests that measure moral reflectivity. This could be because with each new text, the task positive network is engaged, thereby suppressing activity in the default mode network.

“… I soon understood that in serious work commanding and discipline are of little avail.”

In nature, adaptive self-organization is the rule rather than the exception.


we should instead use the brain’s self-organized behavior as a model to argue against imposing external organization on your life, since this more accurately reflects the brain’s composition and dynamics.


The number of ants alive at any given time has been estimated to be around ten million billion. And given that a human weighs approximately one to two million times as much as an ant, ants and humans have roughly the same global biomass.


Ant colonies are capable of very complicated behavior. For instance, ant colonies can learn. A colony quickly finds the best route to a food source, the best place to dispose of dead ants, and even learns to regulate the internal temperature of a nest. Yet each ant has a very tiny brain. An individual ant has no idea what it is doing. How does the extremely organized complex 8 1  behavior of ant colonies arise out of millions of dumb ants each doing their own thing? Especially given that an ant colony has no command and control structure. An individual ant follows a set of very simple rules when going about its daily business, based on whether he’s a worker, a drone, or a soldier.


Adaptive knowledge and information can be processed by the colony, but not by individual ants. Therefore, there are certain attributes of the colony that no individual ant has.


Consider a football team: the team has properties that each player does not, one of which is being a football team made of eleven players. Certain behaviors are only visible at the colony level of description.


Consider a football team: the team has properties that each player does not, one of which is being a football team made of eleven players. Certain behaviors are only visible at the colony level of description


an ant colony can learn the best route to a food source, can build enormous networks of tunnels and nests, and can even grow fungus in complicated underground gardens.


In computer science, there is a famous cellular automata model called Langton’s ant. Imagine an ant called Langton randomly walking around on a grid made of black or white squares. Langton only has two rules: (1) when he lands on a white square he turns 90 degrees to the right, flips the color of the square to black and moves forward one square, (2) when he lands on a black square he turns 90 degrees to the left, flips the square to white and moves forward one unit. No matter how you set up the grid initially, no matter what arrangement of black and white squares you use as an initial configuration, after about ten thousand steps, Langton will start making a repetitive “highway” pattern of one hundred and four steps for infinity. In other words, no matter how he starts off, Langton will converge on this complex pattern. This is only one ant, using only two rules. Langton provides insight as to how the behavior of ant colonies can be so spectacular in the real world.


the individual neurons in our brains do not in themselves know that they are part of your brain, or that they make up “you.” Your consciousness is very much like the army ant’s bivouac. One of the persistent philosophical illusions we’ve had for centuries is that there is some place in our brain where a little person named Homunculus controls the actions of our brains.


“Specialization is for insects.”

Human beings are actually terrible at specialization. This is why every attempt to turn human beings into worker insects for the benefit of rich people results in massive human misery.

Working nonstop has become a new badge of honor among the professional digital class. We walk around with our gadgets trying to define our value propositions. The compulsion that businesses have to organize our lives with apps and calendars comes from deep ignorance of how the brain actually functions.


Albert Einstein, in a much-overlooked 1949 essay called “Why Socialism?”, wrote, “If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. As mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change.”


It is our heart’s ability to flexibly respond to changes in activity that prevents stroke or heart attack. Reduced heart rate variability is a very good predictor of poor cardiac health.


Stress reduces the variability in our heart rate: a low level of anxiety forces the heart to be in a state of preparedness, which it cannot maintain indefinitely.

in nonlinear systems, adding a certain optimal amount of noise actually increases the signalto-noise ratio. In other words, adding noise to a faint signal might actually make the signal stronger.


We do not know at this point what the long-term effects of ADHD medication are, especially on healthy young brains. It is entirely possible that some form of adaption could occur, and less natural dopamine would be produced, which could lead to problems such as depression later in life.

Six Sigma was developed at Motorola in the early 1980s to study and control defects in semiconductor chip manufacturing—and that’s probably where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, like some contagious virus developed at a CDC lab, it escaped the factory. It has now become a horrifying corporate epidemic.


Over the last decade or so, the Six Sigma approach has come under intense criticism. Several large companies such as 3M noticed that when they religiously implemented Six Sigma, innovation slowed to a crawl.


Motorola, where the Six Sigma outbreak started, used to enjoy a huge lead in the mobile phone market. Their dominant position in the market has evaporated. The mobile marketplace is one of the fastest moving and most innovative, and it seems like forcing your opponents to adopt Six Sigma tactics is a good way to cripple them.


The only system we know of in the universe that can be innovative is the human brain. But the brain seems to need things like freedom, long periods of idleness, positive emotions, low stress, randomness, noise, and a group of friends with tea in the garden to be creative.


China has been experiencing exceptional economic growth. China has been increasing its output of goods and services at a rate of about ten percent every year. According to this measurement, every year there are ten percent more goods and services in China than the year before. Does this include things like hamburgers, massages, weddings, and drug dealers? China is also a great example of the theme of this chapter: unchecked economic growth leads to environmental disaster—even in the short term.


To the ancient Greeks, anyone who had to work to make a living was considered a slave.

The less prior experience you have with puzzles, the more you have to gain by learning how puzzles work. Articles and websites on interviewing often suggest strategies for solving interview puzzles. Much of the advice is too broad to be of much use. Other tips involve risky subterfuges. One goes like this: Upon being given a particularly difficult puzzle, say "To be perfectly honest, I've heard that before." With luck, the interviewer gives another, easier question (while crediting you for your "honesty")! Like most tricks, this one does not bear repeating. The odds are stacked against anyone who tries it. Most interviewers see a lot more candidates than candidates see interviewers. Chances are, the average interviewer learns this trick before the average candidate does. And if the interviewer is wise, you're in trouble. You may be asked to recount the answer anyway. It is much more productive, as well as honest, to learn to recognize the "tricks" in the interview questions themselves. On the surface, these questions show bewildering variety. Look inside, and

That which keeps our appetites confined within us, and checks their free access to the outside, poisons our life. Such is selfishness which refuses to give free play to our desires, and prevents them from reaching their real goal, and that is why it is always accompanied by festering untruths and extravagances. When our desires find unlimited freedom in good work they shake off their diseased condition and come back to their own nature;—that is their true end, there also is the joy of their being.

## The Story of my life with letters, John Albert Macy and Annie Sullivan Helen Keller


Any teacher can take a child to the classroom, but not every teacher can make him learn. He will not work joyously unless he feels that liberty is his, whether he is busy or at rest; he must feel the flush of victory and the heart-sinking of disappointment before he takes with a will the tasks distasteful to him and resolves to dance his way bravely through a dull routine of textbooks.

## Memorable thoughts of Socrates, Xenophon


“that kisses of love are not venomous, because you perceive not the poison? Know that a beautiful person is a more dangerous animal than scorpions, because these cannot wound unless they touch us; but beauty strikes at a distance: from what place soever we can but behold her, she darts her venom upon us, and overthrows our judgment. And perhaps for this reason the Loves are represented with bows and arrows, because a beautiful face wounds us from afar. 


some men are so stupid as to prefer their very slaves to their friends. 


‘You are a strange man; we yield you wool, lambs, and cheeses, and yet you give us nothing but what we can get upon the ground; and the dog, who brings you in no profit, is kindly used, for you feed him with the same bread you eat yourself.’ The dog, overhearing this complaint, answered her: ‘It is not without reason that I am used so well. It is I who protect you; it is I who hinder thieves from taking you away, and wolves from sucking your blood. If I were not always keeping watch about you, you would not dare so much as to go to feed.’ 


“You know,” said Socrates, “what things are good and what are bad?” 


For many are daily corrupted because of their beauty; many who presume too much on their own strength are oppressed under the burden of their undertakings. Among the rich, some are lost in luxury, and others fall into the snares of those that wait for their estates. And lastly, the reputation and honours that are acquired in Republics are often the cause of their ruin who possess them.” 


How excellently the seasons are ordered for the fruits of the earth, of which we have such an abundance, and so great a variety, that we find, not only wherewith to supply our real wants but to satisfy even luxury itself.”

He did not reflect, neither, that the sun blackens the sky, which fire does not; nor lastly, that the heat of the sun is necessary to the earth, in order to the production of trees and fruits, but that the heat of fire burns and kills them. When he said, too, that the sun was only a stone set on fire, he did not consider that a stone glitters not in the fire, and cannot last long in it without consuming, whereas the sun lasts always, and is an inexhaustible source of light. 


## The Hindu-Yogi System of Practical Water Cure, Yogi Ramacharaka


Cold water scientifically administered as a drink, will reduce excessive heart action while warm water will increase the heart’s action.


Hot water acts as a powerful stimulant, and also as an antiseptic. It also tends to rest the stomach, and as a sedative.


The best authorities agree that the normal amount of fluids that should be taken by the average person is about two quarts every twenty‑four hours.


About one‑half pint to one pint of water is the amount—taken as hot as it can be drunk with comfort, the usual directions being: “Make it as hot as a cup of hot tea.”


In drinking Hot Water, be sure to pass it through the air as described, particularly if it has been allowed to come to a boil.


In sipping water, allow it to remain in the mouth for a moment or so before swallowing. The nerves of the tongue and the mouth


are those best adapted to absorb the Prana from the Water.


often fill the mouth with water, when tired at work, and passing the tongue through it several times, then spit forth the water.


Its vascular mesh is so extensive that it is capable of drawing to it and holding, in cases of necessity, nearly half of the


supply of blood in the entire body, thus protecting the surface of the body from the effects of extreme cold.


Turkish towel, or bath‑toweling.)


“After a cold application the body should never be wiped dry, with the exception of the head and hands and wrists. The wet body should be at once covered with dry underclothing as quickly as possible, so that the wet parts may be hermetically sealed. Then the outer clothing should be put on at once.


we advise exercise to be taken, either a walk or else work, as soon as the person is dressed after the bath, and this must be continued until the person is perfectly dry and warm.


The Hot Bath.


should be begun by a scrubbing off with the bath mits, as before mentioned, and then followed by a “soaking” in the water for say, fifteen minutes, or so. Then before drying, one should take a wash off or douche of water at a considerably lower temperature.


Never take a Cold Bath when the body is chilled. The proper condition is that of a warm body. If you are chilled when you arise, you should warm up the body by exercise before taking the Cold Bath.


Cold Bath is a matter of short duration, and one should hurry through with it. About one minute should be sufficient for the actual application of the water—in


The Cleansing Bath may be taken daily or at frequent intervals. The Hot Bath should be taken not oftener than once a week; and in case one is traveling it will be found that the ordinary cleansing bath will remove the accumulated dirt, without the need of the Hot Bath. Hot Baths are too relaxing to be taken too often. The Cold Bath may be taken daily, or once or twice a week. Be sure to see that you do not have the water too cold—study the reaction as a guide to the proper temperature.


Foot Baths.


This treatment is especially useful in cases of neuralgia; pains in the stomach; pains in the kidneys; headache, etc.


The Hot Foot Bath acts in the direction of drawing the blood from the head, and also as a sedative and quieter of the nervous system. They are found very useful in the cases of headache, pains in the head or neck, neuralgia, cramps, congestion, etc.


The knees, legs and bucket should be protected from the outside air by means of a blanket placed around the legs of the patient, well tucked around him.


It is well to finish the treatment by pouring cool water over them afterward, then rubbing them dry with some friction, and slapping, and then wrapping them up well in dry warm coverings.


The Cold Foot Bath is a wonderful bracer, and its practice will harden the system and render one immune from colds, etc.


It freshens up the entire system after a day’s work, particularly after one has been standing or walking much during the day, and it brings a sense of relief, rest and vigor which is quite grateful to the tired person. It is conducive to a good night’s sleep, and is advisable in cases of insomnia.


The Cold Foot Bath is applied by placing the feet in a bucket of cold water reaching up to the ankles or over. The feet should be kept in the water from one to three minutes, depending upon the patient’s feelings and tastes in the matter. Finish the treatment by a vigorous rubbing of the feet, accompanied by manipulation and 


The Hindus practice a “wash‑off” system regularly, in addition to their regular baths. This system consists in washing the body,


from the waist down to the feet, by means of a sponge bath, or similar method—every night before retiring; and a similar process applied to the body, from the waist up to the neck, every morning before dressing.

## The Road to Character, David Brooks


If that’s all you have, you spend a lot of time cultivating professional skills, but you don’t have a clear idea of the sources of meaning in life, so you don’t know where you should devote your skills, which career path will be highest and best. Years pass and the deepest parts of yourself go unexplored and unstructured. You are busy, but you have a vague anxiety that your life has not achieved its ultimate meaning and significance. You live with an unconscious boredom, not really loving, not really attached to the moral purposes that give life its worth. You lack the internal criteria to make unshakable commitments. You never develop inner constancy, the integrity that can withstand popular disapproval or a serious blow.


Moral improvement occurs most reliably when the heart is warmed, when we come into contact with people we admire and love and we consciously and unconsciously bend our lives to mimic theirs.


“We won this war because our men are brave and because of many other things—because of Russia, England, and China and the passage of time and the gift of nature’s materials. We did not win it because destiny created us better than all other people. I hope that in victory we are more grateful than proud.”


In a 1976 survey that asked people to list their life goals, fame ranked fifteenth out of sixteen. By 2007, 51 percent of young people reported that being famous was one of their top personal goals.


We have, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman writes, an “almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.” 10 Humility is the awareness that there’s a lot you don’t know and that a lot of what you think you know is distorted or wrong.


Montaigne once wrote, “We can be knowledgeable with other men’s knowledge, but we can’t be wise with other men’s wisdom.” That’s because wisdom isn’t a body of information. It’s the moral quality of knowing what you don’t know and figuring out a way to handle your ignorance, uncertainty, and limitation.


we each have certain talents but also certain weaknesses. And if we habitually fall for those temptations and do not struggle against the weaknesses in ourselves, then we will gradually spoil some core piece of ourselves. We will not be as good, internally, as we want to be. We will fail in some profound way.


On Being a Real Person,


If you don’t have some inner integrity, eventually your Watergate, your scandal, your betrayal, will happen.


character is built not only through austerity and hardship. It is also built sweetly through love and pleasure. When you have deep friendships with good people, you copy and then absorb some of their best traits. When you love a person deeply, you want to serve them and earn their regard. When you experience great art, you widen your repertoire of emotions. Through devotion to some cause, you elevate your desires and organize your energies.


as Kierkegaard put it, “Only the one who descends into the underworld rescues the beloved.”


Self-respect is not based on IQ or any of the mental or physical gifts that help get you into a competitive college. It is not comparative. It is not earned by being better than other people at something. It is earned by being better than you used to be, by being dependable in times of testing, straight in times of temptation.


In this method, you don’t ask, What do I want from life? You ask a different set of questions: What does life want from me? What are my circumstances calling me to do? In this scheme of things we don’t create our lives; we are summoned by life. The important answers are not found inside, they are found outside. This perspective begins not within the autonomous self, but with the concrete circumstances in which you happen to be embedded. This perspective begins with an awareness that the world existed long before you and will last long after you, and that in the brief span of your life you have been thrown by fate, by history, by chance, by evolution, or by God into a specific place with specific problems and needs. Your job is to figure certain things out: What does this environment need in order to be made whole? What is it that needs repair? What tasks are lying around waiting to be performed? As the novelist Frederick Buechner put it, “At what points do my talents and deep gladness meet the world’s deep need?”


Jewish Mishnah puts it, “It’s not your obligation to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from beginning it.”


Today, the word “sin” has lost its power and awesome intensity. It’s used most frequently in the context of fattening desserts. Most people in daily conversation don’t talk much about individual sin. If they talk about human evil at all, that evil is most often located in the structures of society—in inequality, oppression, racism, and so on—not in the human breast.


## A Little Life, Hanya Yanagihara


Fairness is for happy people, for people who have been lucky enough to have lived a life defined more by certainties than by ambiguities. Right and wrong, however, are for – well, not unhappy people, maybe, but scarred people; scared people.


failing people were constantly striving for one thing – success. But successful people were also only striving to maintain their success.

## Fathers and Children, Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev


'I think; here I lie under a haystack.... The tiny space I occupy is so infinitely small in comparison with the rest of space, in which I am not, and which has nothing to do with me; and the period of time in which it is my lot to live is so petty beside the eternity in which I have not been, and shall not be.... And in this atom, this mathematical point, the blood is circulating, the brain is working and wanting something.... Isn't it loathsome? Isn't it petty?'


'man's a strange animal. When one gets a side view from a distance of the dead-alive life our "fathers" lead here, one thinks, What could be better? You eat and drink, and know you are acting in the most reasonable, most judicious manner. But if not, you're devoured by ennui. One wants to have to do with people if only to abuse them.'


it! Why do I like chemistry? Why do you like apples?—by virtue of our sensations. It's all the same thing. Deeper than that men will never penetrate.


A man's ready to give up everything and break with every prejudice; but to admit that his brother, for instance, who steals handkerchiefs, is a thief—that's too much for him. And when one comes to think of it: my brother, mine—and no genius ... that's an idea no one can swallow.'

everything is seen through the filter of ego’s philosophy and logic, making all appear neat, precise, and very logical. We attempt to find a self-justifying answer for every question. In order to reassure ourselves, we work to fit into our intellectual scheme every aspect of our lives which might be confusing. And our effort is so serious and solemn, so straightforward and sincere, that it is difficult to be suspicious of it.


It does not matter what we use to achieve self-justification: the wisdom of sacred books, diagrams or charts, mathematical calculations, esoteric formulae, fundamentalist religion, depth psychology, or any other mechanism. Whenever we begin to evaluate, deciding that we should or should not do this or that, then we have already associated our practice or our knowledge with categories, one pitted against the other, and that is spiritual materialism,


It does not matter what we use to achieve self-justification: the wisdom of sacred books, diagrams or charts, mathematical calculations, esoteric formulae, fundamentalist religion, depth psychology, or any other mechanism. Whenever we begin to evaluate, deciding that we should or should not do this or that, then we have already associated our practice or our knowledge with categories, one pitted against the other, and that is spiritual materialism, the false spirituality of our spiritual adviser.


The simplicity of meditation means just experiencing the ape instinct of ego. If anything more than this is laid onto our psychology, then it becomes a very heavy, thick mask, a suit of armor.


It is important to see that the main point of any spiritual practice is to step out of the bureaucracy of ego. This means stepping out of ego’s constant desire for a higher, more spiritual, more transcendental version of knowledge, religion, virtue, judgment, comfort, or whatever it is that the particular ego is seeking. One must step out of spiritual materialism. If we do not step out of spiritual materialism, if we in fact practice it, then we may eventually find ourselves possessed of a huge collection of spiritual paths.


We searched the world over for beautiful objects—India, Japan, many different countries. And each time we found an antique, because we were dealing with only one object at a time, we saw it as beautiful and thought it would be beautiful in our shop. But when we brought the object home and put it there, it became just another addition to our junky collection.

The teachings are always up-to-date. They are not “ancient wisdom,” an old legend. The teachings are not passed along as information, handed down as a grandfather tells traditional folktales to his grandchildren. It does not work that way. It is a real experience.


There is a saying in the Tibetan scriptures: “Knowledge must be burned, hammered, and beaten like pure gold. Then one can wear it as an ornament.” So when you receive spiritual instruction from the hands of another, you do not take it uncritically, but you burn it, you hammer it, you beat it, until the bright, dignified color of gold appears. Then you craft it into an ornament, whatever design you like, and you put it on.


“The teacher and the whole teaching is on my side.” The spiritual path does not go that way. It is a lonely, individual path.


If you are not willing to let yourself grow, then you fall into the self-destructive process of confusion. It is self-destruction rather than destruction by someone else. That is why it is effective; because it is self-destruction.


Disappointment is a good sign of basic intelligence. It cannot be compared to anything else: it is so sharp, precise, obvious, and direct.


Disappointment is the best chariot to use on the path of the dharma. It does not confirm the existence of our ego and its dreams.


In the Buddhist tradition, there is this basic formula: “I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the dharma, I take refuge in the sangha.” I take refuge in the Buddha as the example of surrender, the example of acknowledging negativity as a part of our makeup and opening to it. I take refuge in the dharma—dharma, the “law of existence,” life as it is. I am willing to open my eyes to the circumstances of life as they are. I am not willing to view them as spiritual or mystical, but I am willing to see the situations of life as they really are. I take refuge in the sangha. Sangha means “community of people on the spiritual path,” “companions.” I am willing to share my experience of the whole environment of life with my fellow pilgrims, my fellow searchers, those who walk with me; but I am not willing to lean on them in order to gain support. I am only willing to walk along with them. There is a very dangerous tendency to lean on one another as we tread the path.


The basic act of surrender does not involve the worship of an external power. Rather it means working together with inspiration, so that one becomes an open vessel into which knowledge can be poured.


This is dealing with your own hypocrisy. The hypocrisy, the pretense and basic twist of ego, is extremely hard; it has a very thick skin. We tend to wear suits of armor, one over the other. This hypocrisy is so dense and multileveled that, as soon as we remove one layer of our suit of armor, we find another beneath it. We hope we will not have to completely undress. We hope that stripping off only a few layers will make us presentable. Then we appear in our new suit of armor with such an ingratiating face, but our spiritual friend does not wear any armor at all; he is a naked person. Compared with his nakedness, we are wearing cement. Our armor is so thick that our friend cannot feel the texture of our skin, our bodies. He cannot even see our faces properly.


However, this love affair with your spiritual friend cannot last forever. Sooner or later its intensity must wane and you must face your own life-situation and your own psychology.


The Sanskrit equivalent for “initiation” is abhisheka, which means “sprinkle,” “pour,” “anointment.” And if there is pouring, there must be a vessel into which the pouring can fall. If we really commit ourselves by opening to our spiritual friend properly, completely, becoming a vessel into which his communication may fall, then he will also open and initiation will occur. This is the meaning of abhisheka or “the meeting of the two minds” of teacher and student.


considering initiation “sacred” is probably seduction by what Buddhists refer to as “the daughters of Mara.” Mara represents the neurotic tendency of mind, the unbalanced state of being, and he sends his daughters to seduce us. When the daughters of Mara take part in initiation in which the meeting of the two minds is actually taking place, they will say, “You feel peaceful? That is because you are receiving spiritual instruction, because this is a spiritual thing that is happening to you, it is sacred.” They have very sweet voices and bring a lovely, beautiful message, and they seduce us into thinking that this communication, this “meeting of the two minds” is a “big deal.” Then we begin to give birth to further samsaric patterns of mind.


You might just own a tiny little castle, but the scope of your protection could extend to cover the entire earth. If you really want to secure yourself completely, there is literally no limit to the efforts you can make.


fundamentally changing yourself is completely unrealistic. No one can really change your personality absolutely. No one can turn you completely upside down and inside out. The existing material, that which is already there, must be used. You must accept yourself as you are, instead of as you would like to be, which means giving up self-deception and wishful thinking.


Self-deception needs the idea of evaluation and a very long memory. Thinking back, we feel nostalgic, getting a kick from our memories, but we do not know where we are at this very moment. We remember the “good times,” the “good old days.” We do not allow our depression to emerge at all, we do not want to accept the suspicion that we are out of touch with something.


As long as you regard yourself or any part of your experience as the “dream come true,” then you are involved in self-deception. Self-deception seems always to depend upon the dream world, because you would like to see what you have not yet seen, rather than what you are now seeing.


Ego is the actions, the mental events.


The only thing to do is to quite painfully unmask.


Self-remembering is quite a dangerous technique, actually. It could involve watching yourself and your actions like a hungry cat watching mice, or else it could be an intelligent gesture of being where you are. The whole point is that, if you have any idea of relationship—I am experiencing this, I am doing this—then “I” and “this” are very strong personalities, equally. Somehow there will be a conflict between “I” and “this.” It is rather like saying that “this” is the mother and “I” the father. With two such polar extremes involved you are bound to give birth to something. So the whole idea is to let “this” not be there, and then “I” will not be there. Or else, “I” is not there, therefore “this” is not there. It is not a matter of telling it to yourself, but of feeling it, a real experience. You must take away the watcher, the observer of the two extremes. Once the watcher is removed, then the whole structure falls apart. The dichotomy remains in existence only so long as there is an observer to keep the whole picture together. You must remove the watcher and the very complicated bureaucracy he creates to insure that nothing is missed by central headquarters.


INASMUCH AS no one is going to save us, to the extent that no one is going magically to enlighten us, the path we are discussing is called the “hard way.”


It takes tremendous effort to work one’s way through the difficulties of the path and actually get into the situations of life thoroughly and properly.


We think that we are special, heroic, that we are turning away from temptation. We become vegetarians and we become this and that. There are so many things to become. We think our path is spiritual because it is literally against the flow of what we used to be, but it is merely the way of false heroism, and the only one who is heroic in this way is ego.


Perhaps we are completely “high” or absorbed for a period of six or seven months. Later our ecstasy disappears. And so it goes, on and on, on and off. How are we going to deal with this situation? We may be able to stay “high” or blissful for a very long time, but then we have to come back or come down or return to normal.


we cannot escape what we are, we carry it with us all the time.


We merely want to savor our beautiful memories. We do not want to question our experiences too closely. It is a sensitive area.


knowing I might get hurt? A: Opening is not a matter of martyring oneself to every threat that comes along. You do not have to stand in front of an oncoming train to open yourself to it. That would be the way of heroism, the false hard way. Whenever we confront something we regard as “evil,” it poses a threat to the self-preservation of ego. We are so busy preserving our existence in the face of this threat that we cannot see the thing clearly at all. To open we have to cut through our desire to preserve our own existence. Then we can see and deal with the situation clearly, as it is.


Struggle is ego. Once you give up struggle, then there is no one left to conquer struggle; it just disappears. So you see, it is not a matter of achieving a victory over struggle.


So the next step on the path of self-deception is the desire to see miracles.


It is the attitude that one has been born fundamentally rich rather than that one must become rich. Without this kind of confidence, meditation cannot be transferred into action at all.


In order to develop love—universal love, cosmic love, whatever you would like to call it—one must accept the whole situation of life as it is, both the light and the dark, the good and the bad.


“Sitting Bull” seems to be a perfect example of this. “Sitting Bull” is very solid and organic. You are really definitely present, resting.


You do not constantly have to manage yourself. You must disown rather than attempt to maintain control, trust yourself rather than check yourself. The more you try to check yourself, the greater the possibility of interrupting the natural play and growth of the situation. Even if what you are doing is chancy, even if it seems possible that the whole affair will blow up and become distorted, you do not worry about it.


The Tibetan word for wisdom is yeshe, which means “primordial intelligence.” You are yourself at the beginning of any beginning. You could almost call it “unoriginated trust in yourself.” You do not have to find the beginning at all. It is a primordial situation, so there is no point in trying to logically find the beginning. It is already. It is beginningless.


Actually it is not Big Brother who is watching; it is Big Me! Another aspect of me is watching me, behind me, just about to strike, just about to pinpoint my failure. There is no joy in this approach, no sense of humor at all.


If we regard the path of spirituality as a battlefield, then we are weak and feeble. Then our progress on the path will depend upon how great an area we have conquered, upon the subjugation of our own and others’ faults, upon how much negativity we have eliminated. Relative to how much dark you have eliminated, that much light you have been able to produce. That is very feeble; one could hardly call it liberation or freedom or mukti or nirvana. You have achieved liberation by defeating something else: it is purely relative.


That is why the Buddha taught the four noble truths, his first teaching. One must begin with the realization of pain, duhkha, suffering. Then having realized duhkha, one goes on to the origin of suffering and the path leading out of suffering and liberation. The Buddha did not begin by teaching

This seduction, the seduction of spiritual materialism, is extremely powerful because it is the seduction of thinking that “I” have achieved something. If we think we have achieved something, that we have “made it,” then we have been seduced by Mara’s daughters, the seduction of spiritual materialism.


If you choose space as your partner in the dance, then of course you want it to dance with you. In order to possess it as a partner, you have to solidify it and ignore its flowing, open quality. This is avidya, ignorance, ignoring the intelligence. It is the culmination of the first skandha, the creation of ignorance-form.


“If I can feel that out there, then I must be here.” Whenever anything happens, one reaches out to feel whether the situation is seductive or threatening or neutral. Whenever there is a sudden separation, a feeling of not knowing the relationship of “that” to “this,” we tend to feel for our ground. This is the extremely efficient feeling mechanism that we begin to set up, the second skandha.


These are the three types of impulse: hatred, desire, and stupidity. Thus perception refers to receiving information from the outside world and impulse refers to our response to that information.


## Ardor, Roberto Calasso


east is the direction of the gods; or otherwise it should face northward, as north is the direction of men. It shall be raised slightly to the south, because that is the direction of the ancestors. If it had been lower to the south, the sacrificer would have soon passed into the underworld; in this way the sacrificer will live long: that is why it is slightly raised to the south.”

## The Wonder that was India: A Survey of the Culture of the Indian Sub-Continent Before the Coming of the Muslims, A. Basham


Many other ancient civilizations, such as those of the Greeks, Romans and Chinese, had to contend with hard winters, which encouraged sturdiness and resource. India, on the other hand, was blessed by a bounteous Nature, who demanded little of man in return for sustenance, but in her terrible anger could not be appeased by any human effort. Hence, it has been suggested, the Indian character has tended to fatalism and quietism, accepting fortune and misfortune alike without complaint.

Even when the art of writing was widely known in India the hymns were rarely written, but, thanks to the brilliant feats of memory of many generations of brāhmans, and the extreme sanctity which the hymns were thought to possess, they have survived to the present day in a form which, from internal evidence, appears not to have been seriously tampered with for nearly three thousand years. This great collection of hymns is the Ṛg Veda, still in theory the most sacred of the numerous sacred texts of the Hindus.


The Vedic hymns are still recited at weddings and funerals, and in the daily devotions of the brāhman.

the gravitational field is not diffused through space; the gravitational field is that space itself. This is the idea of the general theory of relativity. Newton’s “space,” through which things move, and the “gravitational field” are one and the same thing.


The equation fits into half a line, and there is nothing more.


Due to this curvature, not only do planets orbit around the star but light stops moving in a straight line and deviates.


When a large star has burned up all of its combustible substance (hydrogen), it goes out. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of the combustion and collapses under its own weight, to a point where it bends space to such a degree that it plummets into an actual hole.

These simple and clear lines are the real birth certificate of quantum theory. Note the wonderful initial “It seems to me . . . ,” which recalls the “I think . . .” with which Darwin introduces in his notebooks the great idea that species evolve, or the “hesitation” spoken of by Faraday when introducing for the first time the revolutionary idea of magnetic fields. Genius hesitates.

do you remember the periodic table of elements, devised by Dmitri Mendeleev, which lists all the possible elementary substances of which the universe is made, from hydrogen to uranium, and which was hung on so many classroom walls? Why are precisely these elements listed there, and why does the periodic table have this particular structure, with these periods, and with the elements having these specific properties? The answer is that each element corresponds to one solution of the main equation of quantum mechanics. The whole of chemistry emerges from a single equation.


In quantum mechanics no object has a definite position, except when colliding headlong with something else.


They are extremely useful in all contemporary technology. Without quantum mechanics there would be no transistors. But they remain mysterious. For they do not describe what happens to a physical system but only how a physical system affects another physical system.


But there are not many of these, fewer than ten types, in fact. A handful of elementary ingredients that act like bricks in a gigantic Lego set, and with which the entire material reality surrounding us is constructed.


Around every galaxy, astronomers observe a large cloud of material that reveals its existence via the gravitational pull that it exerts upon stars and by the way it deflects light. But this great cloud, of which we observe the gravitational effects, cannot be seen directly and we do not know what it is made of. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed, none of which seem to work. It’s clear that there is something there, but we don’t know what. Nowadays it is called “dark matter.” Evidence indicates that it is something not described by the Standard Model; otherwise we would see it. Something other than atoms, neutrinos, or photons . . .


A handful of types of elementary particles, which vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and nonexistence and swarm in space, even when it seems that there is nothing there, combine together to infinity like the letters of a cosmic alphabet to tell the immense history of galaxies; of the innumerable stars; of sunlight; of mountains, woods, and fields of grain; of the smiling faces of the young at parties; and of the night sky studded with stars.


A university student attending lectures on general relativity in the morning and others on quantum mechanics in the afternoon might be forgiven for concluding that his professors are fools or have neglected to communicate with one another for at least a century. In the morning the world is curved space where everything is continuous; in the afternoon it is a flat space where quanta of energy leap. The paradox is that both theories work remarkably well.


General relativity has taught us that space is not an inert box but rather something dynamic: a kind of immense, mobile snail shell in which we are contained—one that can be compressed and twisted.


General relativity has taught us that space is not an inert box but rather something dynamic: a kind of immense, mobile snail shell in which we are contained—one that can be compressed and twisted. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, has taught us that every field of this kind is “made of quanta” and has a fine, granular structure. It immediately follows that physical space is also “made of quanta.”


Where are these quanta of space? Nowhere. They are not in space because they are themselves the space. Space is created by the linking of these individual quanta of gravity.

If the sun were to stop burning and to form a black hole, it would measure about one and a half kilometers in diameter. Inside this black hole the sun’s matter would continue to collapse, eventually becoming such a Planck star. Its dimensions would then be similar to those of an atom. The entire matter of the sun condensed into the space of an atom: a Planck star should be constituted by this extreme state of matter.

But time does not pass at the same speed for him as for those outside the black hole, for the same reason that in the mountains time passes faster than at sea level. Except that for him, because of the extreme conditions, the difference in the passage of time is enormous, and what for the observer on the star would seem an extremely rapid bounce would appear, seen from outside it, to take place over a very long time. This is why we observe black holes remaining the same for long periods of time: a black hole is a rebounding star seen in extreme slow motion.


Why does heat go from hot things to cold things and not vice versa? It is a crucial question because it relates to the nature of time. In every case in which heat exchange does not occur, or when the heat exchanged is negligible, we see that the future behaves exactly like the past. For example, for the motion of the planets of the solar system heat is almost irrelevant, and in fact this same motion could equally take place in reverse without any law of physics being infringed. As soon as there is heat, however, the future is different from the past. While there is no friction, for instance, a pendulum can swing forever. If we filmed it and ran the film in reverse, we would see movement that is completely possible. But if there is friction, then the pendulum heats its supports slightly, loses energy, and slows down. Friction produces heat. And immediately we are able to distinguish the future (toward which the pendulum slows) from the past. We have never seen a pendulum start swinging from a stationary position, with its movement initiated by the energy obtained by absorbing heat from its supports. The difference between past and future exists only when there is heat. The fundamental phenomenon that distinguishes the future from the past is the fact that heat passes from things that are hotter to things that are colder. So, again, why, as time goes by, does heat pass from hot things to cold and not the other way around? The reason was discovered by Boltzmann and is surprisingly simple: it is sheer chance. Boltzmann’s idea is subtle and brings into play the idea of probability. Heat does not move from hot things to cold things due to an absolute law: it does so only with a large degree of probability. The reason for this is that it is statistically more probable that a quickly moving atom of the hot substance collides with a cold one and leaves it a little of its energy, rather than vice versa. Energy is conserved in the collisions but tends to get distributed in more or less equal parts when there are many collisions. In this way the temperature of objects in contact with each other tends to equalize. It is not impossible for a hot body to become hotter through contact with a colder one: it is just extremely improbable.

intimate connection between time and heat. There is a detectable difference between the past and the future only when there is the flow of heat. Heat is linked to probability; and probability in turn is linked to the fact that our interactions with the rest of the world do not register the fine details of reality.


Using quantum mechanics, Hawking successfully demonstrated that black holes are always “hot.” They emit heat like a stove.

## The Works of Epictetus, Epictetus


This Priscus Helvidius too saw, and acted accordingly; for when Vespasian had sent to forbid his going to the Senate, he answered, “It is in your power to prevent my continuing a senator; but while I am one, I must go.” — “Well then, at least be silent there.” — “Do not ask my opinion and I will be silent.” — “But I must ask it.” — “And I must speak what appears to me to be right.” — “But if you do, I will put you to death.” — “When did I ever tell you that I was immortal? You will do your part, and I mine: it is yours to kill and mine to die intrepid; yours to banish, mine to depart untroubled.” What good, then, did Priscus do, who was but a single person? Why, what good does the purple do to the garment? What, but to be beautiful in itself, and to set a good example to the rest? Another, perhaps, if in such circumstances Cæsar had forbidden his going to the Senate, would have answered, “I am obliged to you for excusing me.” But such a one he would not have forbidden to go; well knowing, that he would either sit like a statue, or, if he spoke, would say what he knew to be agreeable to Cæsar, and would overdo it, by adding still more.

Epictetus may not surpass Socrates; granted: but could I overtake him, it might be enough for me.

“The life of the body is an evil and a lie. Therefore the destruction of the life of the body is a blessing, and we should desire it,” says Socrates. “Life is that which should not be—an evil; and the passage into Nothingness is the only good in life,” says Schopenhauer. “All that is in the world—folly and wisdom and riches and poverty and mirth and grief—is vanity and emptiness. Man dies and nothing is left of him. And that is stupid,” says Solomon. “To life in the consciousness of the inevitability of suffering, of becoming enfeebled, of old age and of death, is impossible—we must free ourselves from life, from all possible life,” says Buddha.

## The Lankavatara Sutra: Translation and Commentary, Red Pine


Chinese commentators say lanka means “unreachable.” Maybe it does, but I don’t know what they base this on. The only definition I can find is that the word refers to the island we now call Sri Lanka or to its principal town. Perhaps the name was derived from the root lankh or lang, which mean “to go to” or “to go beyond” respectively. But if that were true, it would be “reachable.”


Even though the Diamond Sutra replaced the Lankavatara in terms of making the teaching of Zen more accessible to larger audiences, the Lankavatara continued to attract those who appreciated the challenge and the rewards of the more difficult text.

In former days men wished to serve God. When Milton wanted to exercise "that one talent which is death to hide," he felt that his soul was "bent to serve therewith my Maker." Every religiously minded artist was convinced that God's aesthetic judgments coincided with his own; he had therefore a reason, independent of popular applause, for doing what he considered his best, even if his style was out of fashion. The man of science in pursuing truth, even if he came into conflict with current superstition, was still setting forth the wonders of Creation and bringing men's imperfect beliefs more nearly into harmony with God's perfect knowledge.

In practice, people choose the book considered sacred by the community in which they are born, and out of that book they choose the parts they like, ignoring the others.

## The Mongol Empire: Genghis Khan, his heirs and the founding of modern China, John Man


For centuries Mongolia’s nomadic, herding traditions ensured that women matched men in self-reliance. They rode, they ruled, they fought.


Her name was Sorkaktani, and she should be better known, because she was the most remarkable woman of her age.


In Persia, in the mid-nineteenth century, the Nizari imam was appointed governor of Qum, with the new title of Agha Khan, which became hereditary from then on. The Agha Khan led his troops and family into Afghanistan, allied himself to the British and settled in Bombay, where he remained for the next thirty years, rebuilding his wealth and raising racehorses. The present imam, the Harvard-educated Agha Khan IV, ministers to a scattered community of some 15 million Nizaris through the Aga Khan Foundation in Switzerland and his headquarters near Paris; a surprising outcome for a sect whose extreme violence led to their near 


He was after all the spiritual head of all Islam; God was surely on his side. ‘O young man,’ he blustered, ‘do you not know that from the East to the Maghreb, all the worshippers of Allah, whether kings or beggars, are slaves to this court of mine?’ Empty words, as it turned out. Not even a beggar, let alone a king, came to help him.


when all China fell to the Mongols, this would become the capital of the whole united nation, and so it has remained. The heart of today’s Beijing, the Forbidden City, was built right over Kublai’s creation – destroyed after the end of Mongol rule – its entrance facing south, like the door of any Mongolian tent. The 800 palaces and halls, the 9,000 rooms, the entrance from Tiananmen Square – all these are where they are because Kublai chose to place his palace there.


And that opened the way to a world of spirits, in particular to a terrifying, black-faced, six-armed, skull-covered guardian-deity named Mahakala, revered by millions across Asia as the ‘Great Black One’. He is sometimes a manifestation of Shiva, the Destroyer, sometimes one of Shiva’s attendants. Like most Buddhist gods, he varies from culture to culture. In any event, it’s better to have him onside. Kublai adopted him as a ‘tutelary deity’, in the words of the eminent Mongolian historian Shagdaryn Bira. Kublai could ‘pretend to have acquired all his mysterious powers in the cause of ruling his empire. Thus the Mongolian khan could enjoy not only the favour of Tengri, but also the favour of the powerful Tantric god.’


In the late sixteenth century, when the Mongol tribes were constantly vying for supremacy, a Buddhist cleric being cultivated by the dominant khan of the day, Altan, declared Altan to be the reincarnation of Kublai; in return, Altan granted him the title Dalai Lama (dalai being Mongolian for ‘sea’, a traditional symbol of power). Thereafter, it was the Dalai Lama who ruled in Tibet, and remained ruling until 1959, when Mao invaded, ten years after his Communists had seized power.


As far as Mongols were concerned, it was Mongolia that conquered China, Mongolia that occupied Tibet, Mongolia that established a Mongol empire. Fortunately for China, Kublai decided to establish a Chinese dynasty, making his grandfather its posthumous founder, thus turning history upside down. In Chinese eyes, Genghis and Kublai and all their conquests were actually Chinese. And so therefore is Tibet.


ON HIS DEATH, Genghis ruled an empire four times the size of Alexander’s, twice the size of Rome’s, larger than any nation today except Russia. And it was only half complete. By 1300, the Mongols had doubled Genghis’s conquests, adding what is now the rest of China, Korea, Tibet, Pakistan, Iran, most of Turkey, the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), most of habitable Russia, Ukraine and half of Poland. They had probed western Europe, the borders of Egypt, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Japan. One sixth of the world’s land area was theirs; and all this in the space of three generations. The fact that one man, Genghis’s grandson Kublai, was nominal master of this vast estate is one of history’s most astonishing facts.


Many top Mongolians fawned on courtly fashion, took the royal coin, and forgot the simplicity and toughness of their nation’s founder.


The dreadful Timur claimed to be a Genghisid, though he wasn’t. He justified himself as a sort of reincarnation of Genghis – modest roots, heavenly favours, brutal conquests and so on. It was this false claim that explains why Timur’s descendant, Babur, called himself ‘Mughal’ when he seized power in India in the early sixteenth century, establishing a dynasty that ended when the British shuffled the last Mughal off the throne in 1857. His name, by the way, was Bahadur, a distant echo of the Mongol baatar, hero, the second element in Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar (Red Hero). Even today, we remember: a ‘mogul’, originally a wealthy Indian, then a wealthy Anglo-Indian, is now a tycoon.

The distinction between the two categories of intellectuals provides the framework for determining the “responsibility of intellectuals.” The phrase is ambiguous: Does it refer to their moral responsibility as decent human beings, in a position to use their privilege and status to advance the causes of freedom, justice, mercy, peace, and other such sentimental concerns? Or does it refer to the role they are expected to play as “technocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals,” not derogating but serving leadership and established institutions? Since power generally tends to prevail, it is those in the latter category who are considered the “responsible intellectuals,” while the former are dismissed or denigrated—at home, that is. With regard to enemies, the distinction between the two categories of intellectuals is retained, but with values reversed. In the old Soviet Union, the value-oriented intellectuals were perceived by Americans as honored dissidents, while we had only contempt for the apparatchiks and commissars, the technocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals. Similarly, in Iran we honor the courageous dissidents and condemn those who


Take the interesting case of Nelson Mandela, who was only removed from the official State Department terrorist list in 2008, allowing him to travel to the United States without special authorization. Twenty years earlier, he was the criminal leader of one of the world’s “more notorious terrorist groups,” according to a Pentagon report.

“Modesty is a virtue,” he would later write, “yet one gets further without it.”

“You have made a convert of an opponent in one sense, for I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”


Aristotle had recast heredity as the flow of information—a river of code moving from egg to the embryo. Centuries later, Mendel had stumbled on the essential structure of that information, the alphabet of the code. If Aristotle had described a current of information moving across generations, then Mendel had found its currency.


As with Dalton and the atom, neither Bateson nor Johannsen had any understanding of what a gene was. They could not fathom its material form, its physical or chemical structure, its location within the body or inside the cell, or even its mechanism of action. The word was created to mark a function; it was an abstraction.


Newton was a sickly, fragile child; John Calvin was severely asthmatic; Darwin suffered crippling bouts of diarrhea and near-catatonic depression. Herbert Spencer—the philosopher who had coined the phrase survival of the fittest—had spent much of his life bedridden with various illnesses, struggling with his own fitness for survival.


mean height of the sons of exceptionally tall fathers tended to be slightly lower than the father’s height—and closer to the population’s average—as if an invisible force were always dragging extreme features toward the center. This discovery—called regression to the mean—would have a powerful effect on the science of measurement and the concept of variance.


As the front of the American eugenics movement advanced from imprisonment to sterilization to outright murder, European eugenicists watched the escalation with a mix of eagerness and envy. By 1936, less than a decade after Buck v. Bell, a vastly more virulent form of “genetic cleansing” would engulf that continent like a violent contagion, morphing the language of genes and inheritance into its most potent and macabre form.


Over the next decades, a spray of Nobel Prizes would be showered on the occupants of the room: Morgan, his students, his student’s students, and even their students would all win the prize for their discoveries.


Hemophilia—like white eyes in fruit flies—is a sex-linked genetic illness. Females can be carriers and transmit the gene, but only males are afflicted by the disease. The mutation in the hemophilia gene, which affects the clotting of blood, had likely arisen spontaneously in Queen Victoria at birth.

So the final modification might be read as: genotype + environment + triggers + chance = phenotype Succinct, yet magisterial, this formula captured the essence of the interactions between heredity, chance, environment, variation, and evolution in determining the form and fate of an organism.


By the early 1920s, as women like Carrie Buck were being identified and carted off to eugenic camps in America, German eugenicists were expanding their own efforts to create a state-sponsored program to confine, sterilize, or eradicate “genetically defective” men and women.

Organisms exist not because of reactions that are possible, but because of reactions that are barely possible. Too much reactivity and we would spontaneously combust. Too little, and we would turn cold and die. Proteins enable these barely possible reactions, allowing us to live on the edges of chemical entropy—skating perilously, but never falling in.


Nearly every cellular function—metabolism, respiration, cell division, self-defense, waste disposal, secretion, signaling, growth, even cellular death—requires proteins. They are the workhorses of the biochemical world.


One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and the mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid. —James Watson


Science [would be] ruined if—like sports—it were to put competition above everything else. —Benoit Mandelbrot


Sugars provided energy. Fats stored it. Proteins enabled chemical reactions, speeding and controlling the pace of biochemical processes, thereby acting as the switchboards of the biological world.


Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in blood, for instance, performs one of the simplest and yet most vital reactions in physiology. When exposed to high levels of oxygen, hemoglobin binds oxygen. Relocated to a site with low oxygen levels, it willingly releases the bound oxygen. This property allows hemoglobin to shuttle oxygen from the lung to the heart and the brain.


The answer lies in the structure of the molecule. Hemoglobin A, the most intensively studied version of the molecule, is shaped like a four-leaf clover. Two of its “leaves” are formed by a protein called alpha-globin; the other two are created by a related protein, beta-globin.II Each of these leaves clasps, at its center, an iron-containing chemical named heme that can bind oxygen—a reaction distantly akin to a controlled form of rusting. Once all the oxygen molecules have been loaded onto heme, the four leaves of hemoglobin tighten around the oxygen like a saddle clasp. When unloading oxygen, the same saddle-clasp mechanism loosens. The unbinding of one molecule of oxygen coordinately relaxes all the other clasps, like the crucial pin-piece pulled out from a child’s puzzle. The four leaves of the clover now twist open, and hemoglobin yields its cargo of oxygen. The controlled binding and unbinding of iron and oxygen—the cyclical rusting and unrusting of blood—allows effective oxygen delivery into tissues. Hemoglobin allows blood to carry seventyfold more oxygen than what could be dissolved in liquid blood alone. The body plans of vertebrates depend on this property: if hemoglobin’s capacity to deliver oxygen to distant sites was disrupted, our bodies would be forced to be small and cold. We might wake up and find ourselves transformed into insects.


In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. Franklin was not included in the prize. She had died in 1958, at the age of thirty-seven, from diffusely metastatic ovarian cancer—an illness ultimately linked to mutations in genes.


a gene “acts” by encoding information to build a protein, and the protein actualizes the form or function of the organism.


a protein chain can twist and turn in space idiosyncratically, like a wire that has been sculpted into a unique shape. This shape-acquiring ability allows proteins to execute diverse functions in cells. They can exist as long, stretchable fibers in muscle (myosin). They can become globular in shape and enable chemical reactions—i.e., enzymes (DNA polymerase). They can bind colored chemicals and become pigments in the eye, or in a flower. Twisted into saddle clasps, they can act as transporters for other molecules (hemoglobin). They can specify how a nerve cell communicates with another nerve cell and thus become the arbiters of normal cognition and neural development.


The master copy of information—i.e., the gene—was stored permanently in a deep repository or vault. When a “translation request” was generated by a cell, a photocopy of the original was summoned from the vault of the nucleus. This facsimile of a gene (i.e., RNA) was used as a working source for translation into a protein. The process allowed multiple copies of a gene to be in circulation at the same time, and for the RNA copies to be increased or decreased on demand—facts that would soon prove to be crucial to the understanding of a gene’s activity and function.


From bacteria to elephants—from red-eyed flies to blue-blooded princes—biological information flowed through living systems in a systematic, archetypal manner: DNA provided instructions to build RNA. RNA provided instructions to build proteins. Proteins ultimately enabled structure and function—bringing genes to life. 


It was a Rube Goldberg disease. A change in the sequence of a gene caused the change in the sequence of a protein; that warped its shape; that shrank a cell; that clogged a vein; that jammed the flow; that racked the body (that genes built). Gene, protein, function, and fate were strung in a chain: one chemical alteration in one base pair in DNA was sufficient to “encode” a radical change in human fate.


Paris was declared an “open city”—spared from bombs and ruin, but fully accessible to Nazi troops.


As with flies, the bacterial mutants proved revealing. Monod and Jacob, working with Arthur Pardee, a microbial geneticist from America, discovered three cardinal principles that governed the regulation of genes. First, when a gene was turned on or off, the DNA master copy was always kept intact in a cell. The real action was in RNA: when a gene was turned on, it was induced to make more RNA messages and thereby produce more sugar-digesting enzymes. A cell’s metabolic identity—i.e., whether it was consuming lactose or glucose—could be ascertained not by the sequence of its genes, which was always constant, but by the amount of RNA that a gene was producing. During lactose metabolism, the RNAs for lactose-digesting enzymes were abundant. During glucose metabolism, those messages were repressed, and the RNAs for glucose-digesting enzymes became abundant.


A gene, in short, possessed not just information to encode a protein, but also information about when and where to make that protein. All that data was encrypted in DNA, typically appended to the front of every gene


Walter Noel’s red blood cells and liver cells contained the same genetic information—but gene regulation ensured that the hemoglobin protein was only present in red blood cells, and not in the liver. The caterpillar and the butterfly carry precisely the same genome—but gene regulation enables the metamorphosis of one into the other.


Embryogenesis could be reimagined as the gradual unfurling of gene regulation from a single-celled embryo. This was the “movement” that Aristotle had so vividly imagined centuries before.


into every genome, then, are the codes for proteins that will allow that genome to reproduce. This additional layer of complexity—that DNA encodes a protein that allows DNA to replicate—is important because it provides a critical node for regulation. DNA replication can be turned on and turned off by other signals and regulators, such as the age or the nutritional status of a cell, thus allowing cells to make DNA copies only when they are ready to divide. This scheme has a collateral rub: when the regulators themselves go rogue, nothing can stop a cell from replicating continuously. That, as we will soon learn, is the ultimate disease of malfunctioning genes—cancer.


Units of hereditary information, encoded in DNA and packaged on chromosomes, are transmitted through sperm and egg into an embryo, and from the embryo to every living cell in an organism’s body. These units encode messages to build proteins—and the messages and proteins, in turn, enable the form and function of a living organism.


The movement of genetic information from one chromosome to another occurs only under extremely special circumstances. The first occurs when sperm and eggs are generated for reproduction. Just before the spermiogenesis and oogenesis, the cell turns briefly into a playpen for genes. The paired maternal and paternal chromosomes hug each other and readily swap genetic information. The swapping of genetic information between paired chromosomes is crucial to the mixing and matching of hereditary information between parents. Morgan called this phenomenon crossing over (his students had used crossing over to map genes in flies). The more contemporary term is recombination—the ability to generate combinations of combinations of genes.


The second circumstance is more portentous. When DNA is damaged by a mutagen, such as X-rays, genetic information is obviously threatened. When such damage occurs, the gene can be recopied from the “twin” copy on the paired chromosome: part of the maternal copy may be redrafted from the paternal copy, again resulting in the creation of hybrid genes.


(“Excuse my big yawn,” he once told a student, “but I just came from my own lecture [on genetics].”)


We now know that about eight such chemicals—mostly proteins—are made by the fly during the development of the egg and deposited asymmetrically in the egg. These maternal factors are made and placed in the egg by the mother fly. The asymmetric deposition is only possible because the egg itself is placed asymmetrically in the mother fly’s body—thereby enabling her to deposit some of these maternal factors on the head end of the egg, and others on the tail end. The proteins create a gradient within the egg. Like sugar diffusing out of a cube in a cup of coffee, they are present at high concentration on one end of the egg, and low concentration on the other. The diffusion of a chemical through a matrix of protein can even create distinct, three-dimensional patterns—like a pool of syrup ribboning into oatmeal. Specific genes are activated at the high-concentration end versus at the low-concentration end, thereby allowing the head-tail axis to be defined, or other patterns to be formed.


Three features of the cellular map were striking. The first was its invariance.


Every cell knew what to “be” because genes told it what to “become” (and where and when to become).


In human cells, the activation of BCL2 results in a cell in which the death cascade is blocked, creating a cell that is pathologically unable to die: cancer.


But was the fate of every cell in the worm dictated by genes, and only genes? Horvitz and Sulston discovered occasional cells in the worm—rare pairs—that could choose one fate or another randomly, as if by coin flip. The fate of these cells was not determined by their genetic destiny, but by their proximity to other cells.

Notes: 1) the effect of satsang.even cells  are followimg it. 


The identity of an ambiguous cell was, in fact, regulated by signals from neighboring cells—but the neighboring cells were themselves genetically preprogrammed. The God of Worms had evidently left tiny loopholes of chance in the worm’s design, but He still wouldn’t throw dice. A worm was thus constructed from two kinds of inputs—“intrinsic” inputs from genes, and “extrinsic” inputs from cell-cell interactions.


In the proverbial story, the oracle at Delphi is asked to consider a boat on a river whose planks have begun to rot. As the wood decays, each plank is replaced, one by one—and after a decade, no plank is left from the original boat. Yet, the owner is convinced that it is the same boat. How can the boat be the same boat—the riddle runs—if every physical element of the original has been replaced? The answer is that the “boat” is not made of planks but of the relationship between planks.


humans and worms have about the same number of genes—around twenty thousand—and yet the fact that only one of these two organisms is capable of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel suggests that the number of genes is largely unimportant to the physiological complexity of the organism. “It is not what you have,” as a certain Brazilian samba instructor once told me, “it is what you do with it.”

Receiving life from the spirit of Narayana, the egg bursts and the awakened Brahma rises to the surface of the water in the shape of a huge lotus.

The whole pantheism of the Vedanta is contained in the symbol of the bisexual deity Ardhanari. It is surrounded by the double triangle, known in India under the name of the sign of Vishnu. By his side lie a lion, a bull, and an eagle. In his hands there rests a full moon, which is reflected in the waters at his feet. The Vedanta has taught for thousands of years what some of the German philosophers began to preach at the end of last century and the beginning of this one, namely, that everything objective in the world, as well as the world itself, is no more than an illusion, a Maya, a phantom created by our imagination, and as unreal as the reflection of the moon upon the surface of the waters. The phenomenal world, as well as the subjectivity of our conception concerning our Egos, are nothing but, as it were, a mirage. The true sage will never submit to the temptations of illusion. He is well aware that man will attain to self-knowledge, and become a real Ego, only after the entire union of the personal fragment with the All, thus becoming an immutable, infinite, universal Brahma. Accordingly, he considers the whole cycle of birth, life, old age, and death as the sole product of imagination.

But Shudras must not listen on any account to the divine words dictated at the beginning of the world by the four Rishis to Veda Vyasa, the great theologian of Aryavarta. No fires for them, no prayers. As during his life a Shudra never approaches a temple nearer than seven steps, so even after death he cannot be put on the same level with the "twice-born."


Personally, I know several young Brahmans, who, having brilliantly passed the university examinations in England, have had to submit to the most repulsive conditions of purification on their return home; these purifications consisting chiefly in shaving off half their moustaches and eyebrows, crawling in the dust round pagodas, clinging during long hours to the tail of a sacred cow, and, finally, swallowing the excrements of this cow. The latter ceremony is called "Pancha-Gavya," literally, the five products of the cow: milk, curds, butter, etc. The voyage over Kalapani, the black water, that is to say the sea, is considered the worst of all the sins. A man who commits it is considered as polluting himself continually, from the first moment of his going on board the bellati (foreign) ship.


"I have two daughters," he explained, "one five, the other six years old. If I do not find a husband for the eldest of them in the course of the coming year, she will grow too old to get married, nobody will think of espousing her. Suppose I suffer my caste to excommunicate me, both my girls will be dishonored and miserable for the rest of their lives. Then, again, I must take into consideration the superstitions of my old mother. If such a misfortune befell me, it would simply kill her....."

Hindus take their food only twice a day, at ten o'clock in the morning and at nine in the evening. Both meals are accompanied by complicated rites and ceremonies. Even very young children are not allowed to eat at odd times, eating without the prescribed performance of certain exorcisms being considered a sin.


Kshatriyas, and even the much-despised Shudras, may become a sort of left-hand Brahmans. This metamorphosis depends on the will of the real Brahmans, who may, if they like, sell this right for several hundreds or thousands of cows. When the gift is accomplished, a model cow, made of pure gold, is erected and made sacred by the performance of some mystical ceremonies. The candidate must now crawl through her hollow body three times, and thus is transformed into a Brahman. The present Maharaja of Travankor, and even the great Raja of Benares, who died recently, were both Shudras who acquired their rights in this manner.


"Silk possesses the property of dismissing the evil spirits who inhabit the magnetic fluids of the atmosphere,"


People who have studied the ancient philosophy of India with a firm resolve to penetrate the hidden meaning of its aphorisms have for the most part grown convinced that electricity and its effects were known to a considerable extent to some philosophers, as, for instance, to Patanjali.


The Bhadrinath temple of Vishnu possesses a stone bearing evident proof of the fact that Surya-Sidhanta knew and calculated the expansive force of steam many centuries ago. The ancient Hindus were the first to determine the velocity of light and the laws of its reflection; and the table of Pythagoras and his celebrated theorem of the square of hypotenuse are to be found in the ancient books of Jyotisha.


ancient Aryans, when instituting the strange custom of wearing silk during meals, had something serious in view, more serious, at all events, than the "dismissing of demons."


It is curious to compare this Hindu prayer with the celebrated prayer of Descartes' "Meditation III" in his L'Existence de Dieu.


Saharanpur, which attracts every tourist by its charming situation.


It is based on the principles of theocratic rule; but its dogmas are almost totally unknown to Europeans; the teachings, the religious conceptions, and the rites of the Sikhs, are kept secret. The following details are known generally: the Sikhs are ardent monotheists, they refuse to recognize caste; have no restrictions in diet, like Europeans; and bury their dead, which, except among Mussulmans, is a rare exception in India. The second volume of the Adigrantha teaches them "to adore the only true God; to avoid superstitions; to help the dead, that they may lead a righteous life; and to earn one's living, sword in hand."


the masses of India are indifferent and harmless; so that the only existing danger comes from the side of the educated classes. And the English fail to see that the better the education they give them, the more careful they must be to avoid reopening the old wounds, always alive to new injury, in the heart of every true Hindu. The Hindus are proud of the past of their country, dreams of past glories are their only compensation for the bitter present. The English education they receive only enables them to learn that Europe was plunged in the darkness of the Stone Age, when India was in the full growth of her splendid civilization.


Alas! the times when India studied philosophy and astronomy at the feet of her great sages are gone, and the English have transformed the college itself into a warehouse. The hall, which served for the study of astronomy, and was filled with quaint, medieval apparatus, is now used for a depot of opium; and the hall of philosophy contains huge boxes of liqueurs, rum and champagne, which are prohibited by the Koran, as well as by the Brahmans.

The Bhils are the descendants of one of the sons of Mahadeva, or Shiva, and of a fair woman, with blue eyes and a white face, whom he met in some forest on the other side of the Kalapani, "black waters," or ocean. This pair had several sons, one of whom, as handsome as he was vicious, killed the favorite ox of his grandfather Maha-deva, and was banished by his father to the Jodpur desert.


Is not it strange that Apis, the sacred ox of the Egyptians, is honored by the followers of Zoroaster, as well as by the Hindus? The ox Nardi, the emblem of life in nature, is the son of the creating father, or rather his life-giving breath. Ammianus Marcellinus mentions, in one of his works, that there exists a book which gives the exact age of Apis, the clue to the mystery of creation and the cyclic calculations. The Brahmans also explain the allegory of the ox Nardi by the continuation of life on our globe.


But why the Bhils should be almost fair and blue-eyed, whereas the rest of the hill-tribes are almost African in type, is a question that is not answered by this statement.


the superstitions are grafted on the very root, whereas the tongue is subjected to all kinds of changes."


I am sure no one fails to see that the reasoning of scientists sometimes takes a very strange turn when they set to prove some favorite theory of theirs.

Whoever has seen a Hindu wedding in 1879, saw it as it was celebrated in ancient Aryavarta many centuries ago.——


Vedas do not permit matrimony for women under fifteen to twenty years of age, and for men under twenty-five, or even thirty.


Kudva Kunbis,


No Hindu has the right to remain single. The only exceptions are, in case the child is destined to monastic life from the first days of his existence, and in case the child is consecrated to the service of one of the gods of the Trimurti even before he is born.


Even the caste of Brahmacharyas, who take vows of chastity, but take a part and interest in worldly life—and so are the unique lay-celibates of India—are bound to adopt sons. The rest of the Hindus must remain in matrimony till the age of forty; after which they earn the right to leave the world, and to seek salvation, leading an ascetic life in some jungle. If


a member of some Hindu family happens to be afflicted from birth with some organic defect, this will not be an impediment to his marrying, on the condition that his wife should be also a cripple, if she belongs to the same caste. The defects of husband and wife must be different: if he is blind, she must be hump-backed or lame, and vice versa. But if the young man in question is prejudiced, and wants a healthy wife, he must condescend to make a mesalliance; he must stoop to choose a wife in a caste that is exactly one degree lower than his own.


Only the nautches—dancing girls consecrated to gods, and living in temples—can be said to be free and happy.


But the notions of the Hindus, especially on questions of morality, are quite independent, and even anti-Western, if I may use this expression. No one is more severe and exacting in the questions of feminine honor and chastity; but the Brahmans proved to be more cunning than even the Roman augurs. Rhea Sylvia, for instance, the mother of Romulus and Remus, was buried alive by the ancient Romans, in spite of the god Mars taking an active part in her faux pas. Numa and Tiberius took exceedingly good care that the good morals of their priestesses should not become merely nominal. But the vestals on the banks of the Ganges and the Indus understand the question differently from those on the banks of the Tiber. The intimacy of the nautch-girls with the gods, which is generally accepted, cleanses them from every sin and makes them in every one's eyes irreproachable and infallible. A nautcha cannot sin, in spite of the crowd of the "celestial musicians" who swarm in every pagoda, in the form of baby-vestals and their little brothers. No virtuous Roman matron was ever so respected as the pretty little nautcha. This great reverence for the happy "brides of the gods" is especially striking in the purely native towns of Central India, where the population has preserved intact their blind faith in the Brahmans.


Every nautcha can read, and receives the highest Hindu education. They all read and write in Sanskrit, and study the best literature of ancient India, and her six chief philosophies, but especially music, singing and dancing. Besides these "godborn" priestesses of the pagodas, there are also public nautches, who, like the Egyptian almeas, are within the reach of ordinary mortals, not only of gods; they also are in most cases women of a certain culture.


But the fate of an honest woman of Hindostan is quite different; and a bitter and incredibly unjust fate it is. The life of a thoroughly good woman, especially if she happens to possess warm faith and unshaken piety, is simply a long chain of fatal misfortunes. And the higher her family and social position, the more wretched is her life. Married women are so afraid of resembling the professional dancing girls, that they cannot be persuaded to learn anything the latter are taught. If a Brahman woman is rich her life is spent in demoralizing idleness; if she is poor, so much the worse, her earthly existence is concentrated in monotonous performances of mechanical rites. There is no past, and no future for her; only a tedious present, from which there is no possible escape. And this only if everything be well, if her family be not visited by sad losses. Needless to say that, amongst Brahman women, marriage is not a question of free choice, and still less of affection. Her choice of a husband is restricted by the caste to which her father and mother happen to belong; and so, to find a suitable match for a girl is a matter of great difficulty, as well as of great expense. In India, the high-caste woman is not bought, but she has to buy the right to get married. Accordingly, the birth of a girl is not a joy, but a sorrow, especially if her parents are not rich. She must be married not later than when she is seven or eight; a little girl of ten is an old maid in India, she is a discredit to her parents and is the miser-able butt of all her more fortunate contemporaries.


Obligatory marriage for little girls is a comparatively recent invention,


The ancient Aryans knew nothing of it. Even the ancient Brahmanical literature shows that, amongst the pure Aryans, woman enjoyed the same privileges as man. Her voice was listened to by the statesmen; she was free either to choose a husband, or to remain single. Many a woman's name plays an important part in the chronicles of the ancient Aryan land; many women have come down to posterity as eminent poets, astronomers, philosophers, and even sages and lawyers. But with the invasion of the Persians, in the seventh century, and later on of the fanatical, all-destroying Mussulmans, all this changed. Woman became enslaved, and the Brahmans did everything to humiliate her. In towns, the position of the Hindu woman is still worse than amongst agricultural classes.


The sacrifice of the goat is very interesting, so I am going to describe it in detail. A child of the male sex is sent to invite several married ladies, old women of twenty or twenty-five, to witness the worship of the Lares and Penates. Each family has a household goddess of its own—which is not impossible, since the Hindu gods number thirty-three crores. On the eve of the sacrificial day, a kid is brought into the house, and all the family sleep round him. Next morning, the reception hall in the lower story is made ready for the ceremony. The floor is thickly covered with cow-dung, and, right in the middle of the room a square is traced with white chalk, in which is placed a high pedestal, with the statue of the goddess. The patriarch of the family brings the goat, and, holding him by the horns, lowers his head to salute the goddess. After this, the "old" and young women sing marriage hymns, tie the legs of the goat, cover his head with red powder, and make a lamp smoke under his nose, to banish the evil spirits from round him. When all this is done, the female element puts itself out of the way, and the patriarch comes again upon the stage. He treacherously puts a ration of rice before the goat, and as soon as the victim becomes innocently absorbed in gratifying his appetite, the old man chops his head off with a single stroke of his sword, and bathes the goddess in the smoking blood coming from the head of the animal, which he holds in his right arm, over the idol. The women sing in chorus, and the ceremony of betrothal is over.


the goat sacrifice, at which the personal presence of the little girl is not even required—she being represented by the wretched victim—is considered binding for her. As for the man, not only is he permitted to have several lawful wives at a time, but he is even required by the law to marry again if his wife dies. Not to be unjust, I must mention that, with the exception of some vicious and depraved Rajas, we never heard of a Hindu availing himself of this privilege, and having more than one wife.


As soon as the corpse of her husband is burned the widow must shave her head, and never let it grow again as long as she lives. Her bangles, necklaces and rings are broken to pieces and burned, together with her hair and her husband's remains. During the rest of her life she must wear nothing but white if she was less than twenty-five at her husband's death, and red if she was older. Temples, religious ceremonies, society, are closed to her for ever. She has no right to speak to any of her relations, and no right to eat with them. She sleeps, eats and works separately; her touch is considered impure for seven years. If a man, going out on business, meets a widow, he goes home again, abandoning every pursuit, because to see a widow is accounted an evil omen.


In the past all this was seldom practised, and concerned only the rich widows, who refused to be burned; but now, since the Brahmans have been caught in the false interpretation of the Vedas,


During the many centuries that this terrible practice prevailed, the Brahmans had appealed to a certain Vedic text for their justification, and had claimed to be rigidly fulfilling the institutes of Manu, which contain for them the interpretation of Vedic law. When the East India Company's Government first turned its attention to the suppression of suttee, the whole country, from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas, rose in protest, under the influence of the Brahmans.


the alleged precept did not exist in the Vedas; though in the Laws of Manu it was quite distinct, and had been translated accordingly by T. Colebrooke and other Orientalists. An attempt to prove to the fanatic population that Manu's interpretation was wrong would have been equivalent to an attempt to reduce water to powder. So Wilson set himself to study Manu, and to compare the text of the Vedas with the text of this law-giver. This was the result of his labors: the Rig Veda orders the Brahman to place the widow side by side with the corpse, and then, after the performance of certain rites, to lead her down from the funeral pyre and to sing the following verse from Grhya Sutra: Arise, O woman! return to the world of the living! Having gone to sleep by the dead, awake again! Long enough thou hast been a faithful wife To the one who made thee mother of his children.


Approach, you married women, not widows, With your husbands bring ghi and butter. Let the mothers go up to the womb first, Dressed in festive garments and costly adornments.


The line before the last was misinterpreted by the Brahmans in the most skillful way. In Sanskrit it reads as follows: Arohantu janayo yonim agre..... Yonina agre literally means to the womb first. Having changed only one letter of the last word agre, "first," in Sanskrit [script], the Brahmans wrote instead agneh, "fire's," in Sanskrit [script], and so acquired the right to send the wretched widows yonina agneh—to the womb of fire. It is difficult to find on the face of the world another such fiendish deception. The Vedas never permitted the burning of the widows, and there is a place in Taittiriya-Aranyaka, of the Yajur Veda, where the brother of the deceased, or his disciple, or even a trusted friend, is recommended to say to the widow, whilst the pyre is set on fire: "Arise, O woman! do not lie down any more beside the lifeless corpse; return to the world of the living, and become the wife of the one who holds you by the hand, and is willing to be your husband." This verse shows that during the Vedic period the remarriage of widows was allowed.

Here the Ganges is not yet polluted by the dirt and the sins of her many million adorers. Releasing her worshipers, cleansed from her icy embrace, the pure maiden of the mountains carries her transparent waves through the burning plains of Hindostan; and only three hundred and forty-eight miles lower down, on passing through Cawnpore, do her waters begin to grow thicker and darker, while, on reaching Benares, they transform themselves into a kind of peppery pea soup.

We do not allow in our melodies any sounds that cannot be classified amongst the living voices of nature; whereas the modern Chinese tendencies are quite different. The Chinese system comprises eight chief tones, which serve as a tuning-fork to all derivatives; which are accordingly classified under the names of their generators. These eight sounds are: the notes metal, stone, silk, bamboo, pumpkin, earthenware, leather and wood. So that they have metallic sounds, wooden sounds, silk sounds, and so on.


Having noticed that every musical note has its typical representative in the animal kingdom, our ancestors found out that the seven chief tones correspond to the cries of the goat, the peacock, the ox, the parrot, the frog, the tiger, and the elephant. So the octave was discovered and founded.

fire, earth and water. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva all represent these elements by turns, in their different phases; but Shiva is much more the god of the fire than either Brahma or Vishnu: he burns and purifies; at the same time creating out of the ashes new forms, full of fresh life. Shiva-Sankarin is the destroyer or rather the scatterer; Shiva-Rakshaka is the preserver, the regenerator. He is represented with flames on his left palm, and with the wand of death and resurrection in his right hand.

Ibn Sina, Biruni, Khwarazmi, Farabi, Ghazali,


The construction by poet Omar Khayyam (yes, the poet!) of a geo- metrical theory of cubic equations was a genuine breakthrough, as was his extension of arithmetical language to ratios. Khayyam was the first to identify and classify the fourteen types of third- degree equations and to propose geometric proofs for many that had previously confounded ex- perts. He was also among the first, if not the first, to accept irrational num- bers as numbers. In attempting to prove Euclid’s axiom that parallel lines cannot meet, he produced a new theory of parallels. Two Soviet historians of science concluded that some of the propositions derived by Khayyam in his theory of parallels were “essential y the same as the first theorems of the non- Euclidean geometries of Lobachevski and Riemann,”10 both of whom, it should be noted, lived seven hundred years after

One wonders why this craving, longing, for identification exists. One can understand the identification with one's physical needs the necessary things, clothes, food, shelter and so on. But inwardly, inside the skin as it were, we try to identify ourselves with the past, with tradition, with some fanciful romantic image, a symbol much cherished. And surely in this identification there is a sense of security, safety, a sense of being owned and of possessing. This gives great comfort. One takes comfort, security, in any form of illusion. And man apparently needs many illusions.

A ninety-year-old man went to the doctor and said, “Doctor, my eighteen-year-old wife is expecting a baby.” The doctor said, “Let me tell you a story. A man went hunting, but instead of a gun, he picked up an umbrella by mistake. When a bear suddenly charged at the man, he picked up the umbrella, shot the bear, and killed it.” The man said, “Impossible. Someone else must have shot that bear.” The doctor said, “My point exactly!”


First things first, he says. Before we answer any question, big or small, we need to understand what the question itself signifies.

Achilles and the tortoise? Naturally, Achilles can run faster than the tortoise, so the tor toise is given a big head start. At the gun—or as they said in the fifth century b.c., at the javelin—Achilles’s first goal is to get to the point where the tortoise started. Of course, by then the tortoise has moved a little way. So now Achilles has to get to that spot. By the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved again. No matter how many times Achilles reaches the tor toise ’s prior location, even if he does it an infinite number of times, Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise, although he ’ll get awfully close. All the tortoise needs to do to win the race is to not to stop.

A man is worried that his wife is losing her hearing, so he consults a doctor. The doctor suggests that he try a simple athome test on her: Stand behind her and ask her a question, first from twenty feet away, next from ten feet, and finally right behind her. So the man goes home and sees his wife in the kitchen facing the stove. He says from the door, “What’s for dinner tonight?” No answer. Ten feet behind her, he repeats, “What’s for dinner tonight?” Still no answer. Finally, right behind her he says, “What’s for dinner tonight?” And his wife turns around and says, “For the third time— chicken!”


Kant went about the task of answering this question by dividing statements into two categories: analytic and synthetic.

A man goes into the confession booth and tells the priest, “Father, I’m seventy-five years old and last night I made love to two twenty-year-old girls—at the same time.” The priest says, “When did you last go to confession?” The man says, “I’ve never been to confession, Father. I’m Jewish.” The priest says, “Then why are you telling me?” The man says, “I’m telling everybody!”


A couple goes on vacation to a fishing resort. While he’s napping, she decides to take his boat out on the lake and read. While she’s soaking up the sun, the local sheriff comes by in a boat, and says, “There’s no fishing allowed here, ma’am. I’m going to have to arrest you.” The woman says, “But, sheriff, I’m not fishing.” The sheriff says, “Ma’am, you have all the necessary equipment. I’m going to have to run you in.” The woman says, “If you do that, sheriff, I’m going to have to charge you with rape.” “But I haven’t even touched you, ” says the sheriff. “I know, ” she says, “but you have all the necessary equipment.”

## Of Human Freedom, Epictetus


What is the downside for those who refuse to accept it? To be just as they are. [22] Is someone unhappy being alone? Leave him to his isolation. Is someone unhappy with his parents? Let him be a bad son, and grumble. Is someone unhappy with his children? Let him be a bad father. [23] ‘Throw him in jail.’ What jail? The one he is in already, since he is there against his will; and if he is there against his will then he is imprisoned. Conversely, Socrates was not in prison because he chose to be there.


You ought to realize, you take up very little space in the world as a whole– your body, that is; in reason, however, you yield to no one, not even to the gods, because reason is not measured in size but sense.


The gods have released you from accountability for your parents, your siblings, your body, your possessions– for death and for life itself. [34] They made you responsible only for what is in your power– the proper use of impressions. [35] So why take on the burden of matters which you cannot answer for? You are only making unnecessary problems for yourself.


Reputation was the empty noise of fools.


just remember what belongs to you, and you won’t lay claim to what doesn’t.


Is there smoke in the house? If it’s not suffocating, I will stay indoors; if it proves too much, I’ll leave. Always remember– the door is open.


‘You threaten me with death, but nature threatens you.’


If I cherish my body, I make a slave of myself, if I cherish my property, I make a slave of myself; [24] because I’ve disclosed the means to make me captive. When a snake pulls back its head, right away I think, ‘Hit it just there, on the part that it’s protecting.’ In the same way you may be sure that whatever you are seen to protect, that will become your enemy’s focus of attack. [25] Keep this in mind, then there will be no one you will need to fear or flatter.


That is what Socrates practised, maintaining always the same even temper. But it seems that we would practise and study anything rather than how to remain free and unenslaved.


‘Be confident in everything outside the will, and cautious in everything under the will’s control.’


Socrates used to call such fears ‘hobgoblins’, and rightly so; just as masks scare and frighten children since they haven’t seen them before, we react to events in much the same way and for much the same reason.


‘But wasn’t Socrates a writer, and a prolific one at that?’ Yes, but for what purpose? Since there wasn’t always someone available whose ideas he could examine or who could examine Socrates’ own in turn, sometimes he would test and examine himself, forever subjecting to scrutiny one assumption or another.


sometimes he would test and examine himself, forever subjecting to scrutiny one assumption or another. [33] That’s the writing of a real philosopher;


Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received – and the latter lies outside his control.


We agonize over our body, our money, or what the emperor is going to decree – never about anything inside us. I mean, do we worry whether we are going to make an error in judgement? No, because it is under our control. Or having an unnatural urge? No again.


As long as you have this attachment to the body, be ready to submit to anyone or anything of superior physical force.


‘A fool cannot be convinced or even compelled to renounce his folly.’


The same problem occurs in the conduct of life. ‘Good’, ‘bad’, ‘useful’, ‘harmful’– these words are part of everyone’s vocabulary, we all have a preconception of what they signify. But is it developed and complete? [11] Prove it– apply it correctly to particular things. Now Plato, for his part, associates definitions with his preconception of what is ‘useful’; you, however, categorize them as useless. [12] Both of you cannot be right. Some people associate the idea of the good with wealth, or pleasure, or health; others plainly do not. [13] Because if all of us who use these words are not just blowing smoke, and we don’t need help clarifying their preconceptions, why is there any misunderstanding, conflict or blame on either side? [14] But why refer to conflict between different people, and bring up that? Just take yourself– if you are good at applying your preconceptions, why are you internally conflicted and confused?


don’t want anything except what God wants, and no one will stop or stay you, any more than they can stand in the way of God.


When you have him as your leader, and conform your will and desire to his, what fear of failure can you have?


But please stop representing yourself as a philosopher, you affected fool! You still experience envy, pity, jealousy and fear, and hardly a day passes that you don’t whine to the gods about your life. [27] Some philosopher! You learned syllogisms and changing arguments. Good, now try unlearning them, if you can, and make a fresh start. Wake up to the fact that so far you have barely touched the subject.


‘To me those other things are worthless; it’s enough if one day I can live without sorrow and frustration, if I can lift up my head like a free person in the face of circumstance and look to heaven as a friend of God, without fear of anything that might happen.’


And if you’re laid up a mere ten days, when you get up and try to walk any distance you’ll find your legs barely able to support you. [4] So if you like doing something, do it regularly; if you don’t like doing something, make a habit of doing something different. [5] The same goes for moral inclinations. When you get angry, you should know that you aren’t guilty of an isolated lapse, you’ve encouraged a trend and thrown fuel on the fire. [6] When you can’t resist sex with someone, don’t think of it as a temporary setback; you’ve fed your weakness and made it harder to uproot. [7] It is inevitable that continuous behaviour of any one kind is going to instil new habits and tendencies,


If you are seized by greed on some occasion, reason can be invoked to alert you to the danger.


Then the passion will abate and the mind will be restored to its former balance. [9] But if you don’t bring anything by way of relief, the mind will not return to normal; when it’s inflamed by an impression, it will yield to passion more quickly the next time. Keep it up, and the mind grows inured to vice; eventually the love of money is entrenched.


It will even do to socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past.


Don’t let the force of the impression when first it hits you knock you off your feet; just say to it, ‘Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test.’ Next, don’t let it pull you in by picturing to yourself the pleasures that await you. [25] Otherwise it will lead you by the nose wherever it wants. Oppose it with some good and honourable thought, and put the dirty one to rout. [26] Practise this regularly,


It’s a fight for autonomy, freedom, happiness and peace. [29] Remember God, ask him to be your helper and protector, as sailors pray to the Dioscuri for help in a storm.


‘Make a bad beginning and you’ll contend with troubles ever after.’


The body is the raw material of the doctor and physical therapist. Land is the farmer’s raw material. The raw material of the good man is his mind


as soon as you leave in the morning, subject whatever you see or hear to close study. Then formulate answers as if they were posing questions.


The soul is like a bowl of water, with the soul’s impressions like the rays of light that strike the water. [21] Now, if the water is disturbed, the light appears to be disturbed together with it – though of course it is not. [22] So when someone loses consciousness, it is not the person’s knowledge and virtues that are impaired, it is the breath that contains them. Once the breath returns to normal, knowledge and the virtues are restored to normal also.


Free is the person who lives as he wishes and cannot be coerced, impeded or compelled, whose impulses cannot be thwarted, who always gets what he desires and never has to experience what he would rather avoid. Now, who would want to go through life ignorant of how to achieve this? ‘No one.’ [2] Who wants to live with delusion and prejudice, being unjust, undisciplined, mean and ungrateful? ‘No one.’ [3] No bad person, then, lives the way he wants, and no bad man is free.


Diogenes says somewhere that one way to guarantee freedom is to be ready to die.


The man has to learn ‘what each specific thing means’, as Socrates often said, and stop casually applying preconceptions to individual cases. [42] This is the cause of everyone’s troubles, the inability to apply common preconceptions to particulars. Instead the opinions of men as to what is bad diverge. [43] One thinks that he is unwell, when it’s nothing of the kind; the problem is that he is not adapting preconceptions correctly. One imagines that he is poor, another that he has a difficult mother or father, still another that Caesar is not disposed in his favour. This is all caused by one and the same thing, namely, ignorance of how to apply one’s preconceptions.


nature has endowed you with resources to discover the truth. And if you can’t infer the answer yourself using only these resources, [52] listen to what those who have explored the question have to say:


his master is away; when he returns, the man’s true condition will be made plain to you. [59] ‘When who returns?’ Whoever has the means to give or take away any of the things he values.


‘Do we have that many masters?’


Well, what makes for freedom and fluency in the practice of writing? Knowledge of how to write. The same goes for the practice of playing an instrument. It follows that, in the conduct of life, there must be a science to living well.


Is it within your power to have your body perform perfectly whenever you want? ‘No.’ Or be in good health? ‘No.’ Or attractive? ‘Again, no.’ Well, then, the body isn’t yours, and is subject to everything physically stronger. ‘Granted.’ [67] What about land – can you have as much as you want, for as long as you want, in the condition you prefer? ‘No.’ And what about slaves? ‘No again.’ Clothing? ‘No.’ Your house? ‘No.’ Your horses? ‘No to all of the above.’ And if more than anything else you want your children to live, or your wife, your brother, or your friends, is this within your power to effect? ‘No, that isn’t either.’ [68] Is there nothing that is under your authority, that you have exclusive control over – does anything of the kind exist? ‘I don’t know.’ [69] Well, look at it this way. Can anyone make you assent to a false proposition? ‘No, no one can.’ So in the field of assent you cannot be hindered or obstructed. ‘Evidently.’ [70] And can anyone force you to choose something to which you’re opposed? ‘They can: when they threaten me with death or imprisonment, they compel my choice.’ But what if you despise death and imprisonment – are you still in that person’s thrall? ‘No.’ [71] Is your attitude towards death your affair, then? ‘It is.’ Therefore your will is your own business too. ‘I grant it.’


And can you be forced by anyone to desire something against your will? ‘No.’ Or to plan for, or project – or, in a word, regard outside impressions in any one way at all? [75] ‘No again. But when I’ve already conceived a wish for something, they can stop me from getting it.’ If you wish for something that is under your authority and cannot be obstructed, how will they stop you? ‘They can’t.’ And who says if you desire something outside your authority that you cannot be obstructed? [76] ‘Well, should I not desire health, then?’ No – nor, for that matter, anything else outside the limits of your authority; [77] and whatever you cannot produce or preserve at will lies outside your range. Don’t let your hands go near it, much less your desire. Otherwise you’ve consigned yourself to slavery and submitted your neck to the yoke, as you do whenever you prize something not yours to command, or grow attached to something like health that’s contingent on God’s will and variable, unstable, unpredictable and unreliable by nature. [78] ‘So my arm isn’t mine either?’ It’s a part of you, but by nature it is dirt, subject to restraint and main force, a slave to anything physically stronger. [79] And why single the arm out? For as long as its time lasts the whole body should be treated like a loaded donkey. If a donkey is requisitioned and seized by a soldier, let it go: don’t resist or complain, or you’ll be beaten, and lose the animal all the same. [80] And if this is how you should treat the body, what treatment should be reserved for the things that serve the body? If it’s a donkey, then they are the donkey’s bridle, pack saddle, shoes, barley and feed. Let them go too, give them up with even more speed and good grace than you did the animal. [81] When you’re thus practised and prepared to discriminate between what belongs to you and what doesn’t, what is subject to hindrance and what is not, and are ready to regard the latter as important to you and the former as irrelevant, then is there anyone, any more, you need be frightened of? ‘No.’


How is a fortress demolished? Not with weapons or fire – with judgements. We can capture the physical fortress, the one in the city, but our judgements about illness, or about attractive women, remain to be dislodged from the fortress inside us, together with the tyrants whom we host every day, though their identities change over time.


It was God brought you into the world, who showed you the light, gave you the people who support you, gave you reason and perception. And he brought you into the world as a mortal, to pass your time on earth with a little endowment of flesh, to witness his design and share for a short time in his feast and celebration. [105] So why not enjoy the feast and pageant while it’s given you to do so; then, when he ushers you out, go with thanks and reverence for what you were privileged for a time to see and hear.


‘Why did he bring me into the world on these conditions?’ If the conditions don’t suit you, leave. He doesn’t need a heckler in the audience. He wants people keen to participate in the dance and revels – people, that is, who would sooner applaud and favour the festival with their praise and acclamation. [109] As for those who are grumpy and dour, he won’t be sad to see them excluded. Even when they are invited, they don’t act as if they are on holiday, or play an appropriate part; instead they whine, they curse their fate, their luck and their company. They don’t appreciate what they have, including moral resources given to them for the opposite purpose – generosity of spirit, high-mindedness, courage and that very freedom we are now exploring.


‘Because I don’t consider the body to be my own, because I lack for nothing, and because the law is the only thing I esteem, nothing else.’ That’s what enabled him to be free.


A good actor preserves his reputation not by speaking lines out of turn but by knowing when to talk – and when to keep quiet.


Plato says, not just for death, but for torture, exile, flogging – and the loss of everything not belonging to you. [173] You will be a slave among slaves otherwise; even if you are a consul ten thousand times over, even if you make your residence on the Palatine, you will be a slave none the less.


For you will learn by experience that it’s true: the things that men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once they’re theirs.


For you will learn by experience that it’s true: the things that men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once they’re theirs. Meanwhile people to whom such things are still denied come to imagine that everything good will be theirs if only they could acquire them. Then they get them: and their longing is unchanged, their anxiety is unchanged, their disgust is no less, and they still long for whatever is lacking. [175] Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it. [176] Assure yourself of this by expending as much effort on these new ambitions as you did on those illusive goals: work day and night to attain a liberated frame of mind. [177] Instead of a rich old man, cultivate the company of a philosopher, be seen hanging around his door for a change.

You should be especially careful when associating with one of your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level; otherwise you will lose yourself.


It is a general rule that externals of any kind, if we attach importance to them, make us subject to somebody. [2] It makes no difference whether we wish to be a senator, or wish not to be one; whether we desire to have office, or to avoid it; whether we say, ‘I can’t do anything, unfortunately, I’m tied to my books like a stiff,’ or, ‘Sadly, I have no leisure for study.’ [3] A book is an external, just like office or public honours. [4] Why do you want to read anyway – for the sake of amusement or mere erudition? Those are poor, fatuous pretexts. Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn’t make you peaceful, what good is it?


What kind of peace is this that is so easily shattered – not by the emperor or even by a friend of the emperor, but by a crow, a street musician, a cold, or a thousand other annoyances? True peace is characterized by nothing so much as steadiness and imperturbability.


But life is composed of things other than books. It is as if an athlete, on entering the stadium, were to complain that he’s not outside exercising. [12] This was the goal of your exercise, of your weights, your practice ring and your training partners. You want them now that the time to exploit them has arrived? [13] Or it’s as if, in the matter of assent, when faced with impressions, instead of distinguishing which ones are convincing and which are not, we prefer to read a book entitled On Comprehensive Impressions.


you must laugh at someone who is anxious that he won’t hold office, then laugh at yourself as well.


Just keep in mind: the more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.


You should dissociate yourself from everything outside yourself – the body, possessions, reputation, books, applause, as well as office or lack of office. Because a preference for any of them immediately makes you a slave, a subordinate, and prone to disappointment. [34] Keep Cleanthes’ verse handy: Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny.


go to Rome. To Gyara? All right, I go to Gyara instead. To Athens? Then Athens it is. To jail? Well then I go to jail. [35] But if you ever think, ‘When do we get to go to Athens?’ you are already lost. Either you’re going to be depressed when your wish is not realized or foolishly pleased with yourself if it is, overjoyed for the wrong reasons.


Otherwise, look, you will always have to serve the person who is able to secure your release, or the person who can block your way. You will have to serve him the way you would an evil deity.


There is one road to peace and happiness (keep the thought nearby morning, noon and night): renunciation of externals; regarding nothing as your own; handing over everything to fortune and the deity. Leave those things in the care of the same people God appointed to govern them, [40] while you devote yourself to the one thing that is truly yours and that no one can obstruct; make that the focus of all your reading, your writing and your lecture attendance.


Never praise or blame people on common grounds; look to their judgements exclusively. Because that is the determining factor, which makes everyone’s actions either good or bad.

the power of the word: words make things happen. The physical actions of ritual alone would be insufficient; it is the skillfully crafted, properly formulated hymn, the verbal portion of the ritual, that makes the liturgical acts effective.


The word for “truth” is r̥ta﻿́,


The term r̥ta﻿́ essentially defines what a being or object is and what it does, and it structures the relationships of beings and objects with other beings and objects.


adhidaivam or adhidevatam, roughly “concerned with the divine,” while the mundane is called adhyātmam, roughly “concerned with the person(al).”

rays of light at dawn are homologized to cows, as in the Vala myth discussed above, and therefore the goddess Dawn is called “the mother of cows” and images of ruddy cows overrun the hymns to Dawn.


Cows also have a ritual association: milk is mixed with the soma juice after it is pressed, and so the soma hymns are filled with depictions of the soma (as bull) running toward or mixing with “the cows,” that is, the milk. And cows are also homologized to waters, particularly the waters confined by Vr̥tra and released by Indra’s killing of that demon.


brahma﻿́n is the “formulator,” who discerns and puts into words the hidden truths that undergird reality. His product is a bra﻿́hman, a “sacred formulation.”


Āhavanīya (the fire “to be offered into”) set to the east, the Gārhapatya (“householders’ fire”) to the west, from which the Āhavanīya is taken out and carried to the east, and the Dakṣiṇāgni (“southern fire”),


puro﻿́hita “placed to the east/in front,”


The ritual became less an invitation to the gods and more a manipula- tion of them. One marker of this shift was the rise in the later Veda of Prajāpati,


This is perhaps most obviously the case for the brahma﻿́n. In the later ritual the brahma﻿́n became the formal overseer of the ritual. In the R̥gveda he was rather the poet who formulates the truth


Hotar is the priest who recites the hymns and is secondarily associated with the root √ hū “call,” his name originally meant the “pourer” (derived from the root √ hu “pour”), which indicates that his ancient function was both to pour the offerings and to recite. In the R̥gveda he was likely often the composer of the hymns he recited as well.


As we shall see, the R̥gveda attaches great importance to the names of gods. By invoking, varying, and meaningfully placing gods’ names in their verses and by echoing the sounds of those names, the poets bring about the presence of the gods,


The god is who the god is because the god obeys the truth embedded in that name. Thus the goddess Dawn is the Dawn because she adheres to the truth that she appears in the morning before the sun.


To be sure, the meanings of the names of some gods, such as Viṣṇu, the Nāsatyas, or the Maruts, are unclear or controversial, and the names of other gods, such as the Aśvins (“Horsemen”), imperfectly represent their charac- ters.


Starting with their names, we can classify gods according to their different spheres of action. This categorization will be porous, since some gods cross bound- aries of domains and functions, and will be more orderly than R̥gvedic reality, but it gives an approximate shape to the R̥gvedic pantheon. There are at least five categories of divinities. First


second category of divinity includes

An apparent mirror image of this paired opposition is found in Old Iranian in the Avestan texts, where ahura, the direct cognate of Sanskrit a﻿́sura, is the title of the head of the pantheon, Ahura Mazdā “Lord Wisdom,” and the daēuua s (exact cognate of Sanskrit deva﻿́) are the enemies of all that is good.


In his role as priest-king Indra is also called bŕ̥haspa﻿́ti, the “lord of the sacred formulation.” Br̥haspati appears not only as Indra, but also as a separate divinity alongside Indra.

He stretches out his arms in a gesture of command (II.38.2). Falk (1988: 17–22) reasonably suggests that his brilliance during the night and his outstretched arms point to the Milky Way as a manifestation of Savitar.


If the Milky Way is the celestial embodiment of Savitar, Sūrya, the Sun, comes close to being that of Mitra and Varuṇa. The Sun is their eye, for his gaze is wide (VII.35.8) and falls on everyone (I.50.2). The Sun watches over the good and evil deeds of humans


Since he is so closely linked to the Ādityas, he himself is called an Āditya (I.50.13, 191.9; VIII.101.11).


However, Sūrya is not associated exclusively with the Ādityas. He is a form of Agni, Agni Vaiśvānara, and the face of Agni.


Dawn is one of the few female divinities in the R̥gveda and the most prominent among them. Twenty-one hymns are dedicated to her alone


Dawn is also, not surprisingly, associated with the god Sun, Sūrya, who is often depicted as following her as her suitor or husband.


Her associations are not all positive, however. Because she heralds every new day, she reminds men of the unstoppable passage of time and of the aging process, as well as of the generations of men who used to view the dawn but have passed away.


Dawn’s daily rebirth as an ever-young beauty presents a cruel contrast to the human condition of change and decay. The poets also often reflect on the paradox that each Dawn is new but each is the same as the one before and the one that will come after.


Such characteristics show Vāyu’s close connection to the wind, even though he does not represent the wind directly.


The ordinary word for the wind is vā́ta, and unlike Vāyu, the god Vāta closely reflects the character and activity of the wind. He goes shattering and thundering, raising the dust; he moves through the midspace and is the companion of the waters. The symbolic features of Vāta likewise reflect the wind. Vāta is the breath ( ātma﻿́n) of the gods (X.168.4), and as the lifebreath, he is the father, brother, and companion of the man whom he makes live (X.186.1–3).


The Aśvins are connected with honey, ma﻿́dhu,


They are the fourth most frequently invoked deities in the R̥gveda after Indra, Agni, and Soma.


dyaúṣ pitā́ “father Heaven”


In the R̥gveda, Heaven as a divinity is generally paired with the female Earth,


They are normally grammatically joined in a dual dvandva compound ( dyā́vā-pr̥thivī́), and several hymns are dedicated to this couple.


The meaning of Tvaṣṭar’s name is fully transparent: he is the “Fashioner,” who “adorned all the creatures with their forms” (X.110.9) and who knows all living things (IV.42.3). But his role is more complex than his name might imply. He is the father of Indra


Pūṣan in several passages is said to be the husband or consort of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, who is the archetypal bride in the R̥gveda, and he is also said to be the lover of his sister and the wooer of his mother (VI.55.4–5), though this apparent incest provokes no blame. The tangled family relations thus alluded to are not treated in any detail,


therefore the god who is wide-ranging ( urugāya﻿́) and wide-striding ( urukrama﻿́).


Śiva, “the kindly one,”


on the one hand, he is fierce and malevolent, with an often inexplicable anger that needs to be appeased; on the other, he is a healer, who controls the remedies for disease. He is also, as noted above, the father of the Maruts, who are much more prominent in our text.


R̥gveda provides little or no evidence for her later role as patron of learning and the arts,


The females in these hymns are quite outspoken, usually about sex, and their male conversation partners tend to look weak and helpless in comparison.


Sanskrit is an inflectional language with an especially rich morphology, and most of the grammatical information that is carried in English by word order and by separate elements such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs is coded in Sanskrit on the word itself.


We refer the interested reader to Jamison (2004b) for a very skeletal account and to any standard Sanskrit reference grammar for more details. Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar for Students (Macdonell 1916) is admirably clear and informative, and the classic Sanskrit reference grammar is Whitney (1889).


the vocabulary they use is simply enormous relative to the size of the text: Grassmann’s lexicon of the R̥gveda is a very fat volume, with 1685 pages of lemmata—a giant word-hoard, full of rarities and hapax legomena, slang and colloquialisms.


R̥gveda X.129 links the creativity of poets to the creation of the world.


Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron (¯). Light syllables contain a short vowel followed by, at most, a single consonant and are symbolized by a breve (˘).


a noun is indefinite (“a horse”) or definite (“the horse”),


Even the sixty-seven gāyatrī hymns to Soma Pavamāna that occupy the first half of the IXth Maṇḍala and are extremely narrowly focused on a very few steps of ritual procedure manage an astounding amount of variety within these metrical and topical limits. In fact, they might serve as a textbook of how a R̥gvedic poet deploys his skills to produce multiple, very different versions of a simple and single message.


Agni is “placed to the fore” (vs. 1) because the principal fire of the sacrifice is placed in the east of the sacrificial area


The actual content of the two hymns is quite simple. In I.2 the first two tr̥cas to Vāyu and Indra and Vāyu respectively announce that the soma has been pressed and urge the gods to come to our sacrifice. The tr̥ca to Mitra and Varuṇa is slightly more interesting, in that it mentions the frequently conjoined notions of “insight” I.3 91 ( dhī́), “skill” ( da﻿́kṣa), and “resolve” or “purpose” ( kra﻿́tu), the three elements necessary to conceive and carry out an action.


feature of the hymn is an instance of the famous, but relatively rare, formula “imperishable fame” ( śra﻿́vaḥ. . . a﻿́kṣitam) in verse 7, where the two words are found in separate pādas (b and


3. O you of the lovely lips who govern all domains, reach exhilaration through the exhilarating praise songs here at these soma-pressings.


Agni we choose as messenger, the Hotar affording all possessions, very effective for this sacrifice.


Agni after Agni they always invoke with invocations as the clanlord, conveyor of the oblations, dear to many.


O shining one whose oblation is ghee, burn against those who do harm, o Agni, against demonic beings.


By Agni is Agni kindled—poet, houselord, youth, conveying the oblation, with the sacrificial ladle in his mouth.


The lord of the oblation who honors you as his messenger, o god Agni, for him become a helper.


Agni, with your blazing flame, along with all the invocations to the gods, enjoy this praise of ours right now!


Agni, with your blazing flame, along with all the invocations to the gods, enjoy this praise of ours right now! I.13

I.13 Āprı ̄ Medhātithi Kāṇva


Well-kindled, o Agni, convey the gods here to us, to the man offering the oblation, and perform sacrifice, o pure Hotar.


The two well-tongued poets, the Divine Hotars, I invite. Let them perform this sacrifice for us right here. 9. Iḍā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, the three goddesses who are joy itself— let them sit, unfailing, on the ritual grass.


2. He who is rich, who smashes afflictions, while finding goods and increasing prosperity, let him accompany us, he who is powerful. 3. Let not the (male)diction, the malice of the grudging mortal reach us. Guard us, Lord of the Sacred Formulation.


5. Those who through truth increase by truth, the lords of truth, of light, these two, Mitra and Varuṇa, do I call.


19. Within the waters is deathlessness, in the waters healing, and (it is right) to glorify the waters. O gods, become prizewinners. 20. “Within the waters,” Soma said to me, “are all healing remedies, and Agni who is weal to all.” And the waters are healing for 


21. O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my body and (for me) to see the sun for a long time. 22. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me— whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth. 23. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap. Full of milk, come here, o Agni. Merge me with luster.


I.24 Agni, Savitar, and Varuṇa Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti


Aditi, the goddess who represents Innocence or Guiltlessness,


Both Savitar and Bhaga are Ādityas, so the poet is still moving toward Varuṇa, the greatest of the Ādityas.


A hundred healers are yours, o king, a thousand. Let your favor be broad and deep. Drive dissolution far away into the distance. Release from us even the guilt we have created.


Varuṇa’s glory is “right here within our bellies.” We understand the presence of Varuṇa’s glory in the belly as signifying the


radical closeness of Varuṇa, but there are other ways of interpreting it. The reference to “bellies” has led Geldner, for example, to understand this as a healing hymn for dropsy, a disease associated with Varuṇa.


1. Put on your garments, you partaker of the sacrificial meal and lord of nourishments, and so perform this rite for us. 2. Take your seat as our Hotar, worthy to be chosen by our thoughts and heaven-bound speech, o youngest Agni. 3. For a father always sacrifices on behalf of his son, a friend on behalf of his friend, a comrade worth choosing on behalf of his comrade. I.27 125 4. Let Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, who care for the stranger, take their seats here on our ritual grass, as if (on that) of Manu. 5. O ancient Hotar, rejoice in this (ritual grass) and in our comradeship; listen well to these songs here. 6. For even when we sacrifice to god after god in unbroken succession, it is just in you that the oblation is poured. 7. Let him be our dear clanlord—the delighting Hotar worthy to be chosen; let us be dear (to him) and (so) possess good fires. 8. Since the gods have good Agni (among them) and established him as a choice thing for us, we consider ourselves to possess good fires [/Agni]. 9. So then, of us both, mortals (and immortals), o immortal one, let there be encomia each for the other. 10. O Agni, along with all the fires, take delight in this sacrifice and in this speech, o young (son) of strength.


Both from afar and from nearby, from the mortal who wishes ill protect us always, you who last a whole lifetime.


You are the apportioner, o bright-beamed one. (As if) on the wave of a river, in the nearness and all at once you stream for the pious man.


The mortal whom you will help in battles, o Agni, whom you will spur on to the prizes, he will hold fast to unfailing refreshments.


Let him who is great without measure, much glittering but possessing a beacon of smoke, urge us on to insight and to the prize.


Reverence to the great ones and reverence to the small; reverence to the young and reverence to those advanced (in years). Let us offer sacrifice to the gods if we will be able. Let me not twist away the laud for one more powerful in my direction, o gods.


I.28 Indra (1–4), the Mortar (5–6), the Mortar and Pestle (7–8),


You, Agni, are (fatherly) solicitude, you a father to us. You are creator of vitality; we are your kin. Riches in hundreds, in thousands converge on you, the well-heroed protector of the commandment, o undeceivable one.

Notes: 1) evening chants for savitar 


There are three heavens: two are the laps of Savitar, one is the hero-vanquishing one in the world of Yama. Like a chariot (wheel) on the axle-pin, the (creatures) have taken their place on his immortal (foundations?).—Whoever will perceive this, let him declare it here.


6. Just in you who bring good fortune is every oblation poured, o youngest Agni. Benevolent toward us today and in the future, sacrifice to the gods for masses of good heroes.


Sit together (with us): you are great. Blaze as the best at pursuing the gods. Let loose your beautiful red smoke in every direction, o lauded Agni, partaker of the ritual 


Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar, upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with their ornaments in invoking (you).


Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar, upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with their ornaments in invoking (you). 14. Upright, protect us from narrow straits with your beacon. Burn up every devourer. Make us upright to move and to live. Find favor for us among the gods. 15. Protect us from the demon, o Agni. Protect us from the malice of the enemy. Protect from the man who does harm or who seeks to smash us, o youngest one with lofty beams. 16. As if with a deadly weapon, smash asunder our enemies and whoever deceives us, o you of scorching fangs. The mortal who sharpens himself throughout the nights, let that cheat not be master of us.


Speak here with a song at length to the Lord of the Sacred Formulation, to awaken him, and to Agni, lovely to see like an ally.


For a rival to you has not been found in heaven nor on earth, o you who care for the stranger. Yours be the might, with your full lineage as yokemate; o Rudras, let it never be open to challenge.


Just that would we speak at the rites—the faultless mantra that brings good fortune, o gods. And if you gladly receive this speech, o noble men [=gods], it will attain all things of yours worth winning.


Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman— that person is never deceived. 2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect from harm, he thrives, unharmed and whole. 3. The kings [=Ādityas] smash apart the hard places, apart the hostilities in front of them; they lead across difficult ways. 4. The path is easy to go on and harmless to men for the one going to truth. There is no fissure there for you. 5. The sacrifice that you lead along the straight path, o superior men, Ādityas, that will reach you for insight.


Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman— that person is never deceived. 2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect from harm, he thrives, unharmed and whole.


Agni, immortal one—the bright benefit radiating from Dawn: convey it here to the pious man, o Jātavedas; convey here today the gods who wake at dawn. 2. For you are the delightful messenger, conveyor of oblations, o Agni, charioteer of the ceremonies. Jointly with the Aśvins and with Dawn establish in us good heroism and lofty fame.


3. Today we choose as messenger Agni the good one, dear to many, whose beacon is smoke, but who is foamy with radiance when the dawns break, the glory of the ceremonies, of the sacrifices. 4. The fairest, the youngest guest, well-libated, delightful to the pious folk— I reverently invoke Agni Jātavedas when the dawns break, to journey to the gods. 5. I will praise you—o immortal nurturer of all— as immortal guardian—o Agni, partaker of the ritual meal—as best sacrificer—o conveyor of the oblation.


The inspired poets whose soma is pressed have roused you to delight— they bearing the lofty light, the oblation for the pious mortal, o Agni.


1. Up do the beacons convey this god Jātavedas, the Sun, for all to see.


10. Looking up from the darkness to the higher light, we have come up to the Sun, god among the gods, the highest light. 11. As you go up today, o you of Mitra’s might, and mount the higher heaven, banish my heart-affliction and jaundice, o Sun. 12.


11. As you go up today, o you of Mitra’s might, and mount the higher heaven, banish my heart-affliction and jaundice, o Sun. 12.


1. The other fires are just twigs of you, Agni. In you do all the immortals bring themselves to euphoria. Vaiśvānara, you are the navel of the settlements. Like a pillar, as prop you hold the peoples fast.


the dative asmaí “for him” or the genitive asyá “of him,”


It is difficult to do justice to this tour de force of poetic craft, and many of its finest effects have not been discussed here. It is, unfortunately, even more difficult to do justice to it in English translation.


Salute the two world-halves [= ro﻿́dasī ], you who are splendor in a flock, who accompany the superior man [=Indra], champions with a snake’s fury in your strength. She [=Rodasī], like lightning lovely to look at, has mounted your chariot like the ensign on chariot boxes, o Maruts.


As is generally the case with dvipadā virāj meter, the hymn falls into two-verse units, essentially equivalent to a single trimeter verse (forty syllables, versus forty-four [triṣṭubh] or forty-eight [jagatī]).


1. Hiding in secret like a thief with livestock, yoking homage, conveying homage: 2. (You) did the clever, of one accord, follow along your tracks; all those worthy of the sacrifice reverently approached you. 3. The gods followed the commandments of truth. Like heaven (enclosing) the earth was his enclosing. 4. With wonder the waters strengthen the lovely child, well-begotten in the lap of truth, in its womb. 5. Like thriving that brings delight, like a broad (place of) peaceful dwelling, like a mountain a source of benefit, like a gush (of water) that brings blessings; 6. Like a steed on its course, launched in a surge, like a river (sending) its gush: who can obstruct him? 7. Akin to the rivers, like a brother to his sisters, (yet,) like a king his vassals, he devours the wood. 188 I.66 8. When, sped by the wind, he has spread out through the wood, Agni cuts the hair of the earth. 9. He hisses like a wild goose sitting in the waters; awakening at dawn, he is the most conspicuous to the clans by his intention. 10. Like soma, a ritual expert, begotten of truth; ranging widely like livestock with their young, far-radiant.


Delightful like a home, he maintains peace; ripe like grain, a conqueror of peoples. 4. Having rhythm like a seer, lauded among the clans; well treated like a winning horse, he confers vitality.


4. All have a share in divinity and in its name, as they serve immortal truth in their own ways.


1. Might we vanquish the many inspired thoughts of the stranger by our inspired thought; might bright-blazing Agni attain all things (for us), 2. Watching over all the divine commandments and the races of the people descended from Manu. 3. He who is the embryo of the waters, the embryo of the woods, and the embryo of the still, the embryo of the moving, 4. Even in the rock (as well as) within the house, every immortal, like every (member) of the clans, is very attentive to him. 5. For Agni, the protector of riches on earth, does ritual service (for him [=the mortal]) who does ritual service for him [=Agni] fittingly with good hymns. 6. O watchful (Agni), protect these worlds, since you know the races of gods and of mortals. 7. Whom they will make grow through the many nights (and dawns) of differing forms— the one conceived by truth (whom) the moving and the still (will make grow), 8. He has been brought to success, installed as Hotar, as the sun, performing all the tasks to be realized. 9. You acquire a laud among the cows and the (fire)wood. All bear tribute to (you), our sun. 10. Men serve you separately in many places; they bear (you) away separately as (sons bear away) the property of their aging father. 11. Avid like (a horse) heading to the goal, like a champion archer, fearsome like a (chariot-)driver, dazzling in combats.


1. Who confers vitality like wealth acquired from one’s father, providing good guidance like the instruction of a perceptive man, resting in a comfortable place like a guest whose pleasure is served, like a Hotar he has traversed the (sacrificial) seat of him who does honor. 2. Whose thoughts become reality like god Savitar’s, who protects all communities according to his will, lauded by many like a (royal) emblem, really present and agreeable like one’s own self, he has become desirable to install. 3. Who, suckling all, dwells peacefully upon the earth, like a god, like a king with established alliances, stationed in front like heroes stationed for protection, irreproachable like a wife pleasing to her husband— 4. You, o Agni, kindled here in the house as their own, do men attend on in their fixed abodes. They deposited abundant heavenly brilliance within him. Become the foundation of riches for your whole lifetime! I.74 199 5. Might the bounteous ones reach nourishments, o Agni, and (might) the patrons who give (reach) through a whole lifetime. Might we gain the victory-prize in our clashes with the stranger, acquiring a portion among the gods for our fame. 6. For the bellowing cows of truth, apportioned by heaven, swell with their udders; from afar, seeking a portion of (your?) favor, the rivers have flowed forth all at once over the rock. 7. Seeking a portion of favor in you, those worthy of worship [=gods] set their fame in heaven. They made night and dawn of different forms, and they put together the black color and the red. 8. Might we—we and our patrons—be those mortals whom you will sweeten for wealth, o Agni. Like a shadow you accompany all creation, having filled the two world-halves and the space between. 9. Might we vanquish steeds with steeds, men with men, and heroes with heroes, o Agni, when aided by you. As lords of wealth acquired from their fathers, might our patrons, having a hundred winters, reach through (a whole lifetime). 10. Let these solemn speeches be pleasing to you, o Agni, ritual expert—to your mind and heart. Might we be able to control (the prizewinning horses) of your wealth, (so they are) amenable to the chariot-pole, while we acquire the fame apportioned by the gods.


1. Take delight in the most extensive speech, which affords most delight to the gods, while pouring the oblations into your own mouth. 2. Then, o Agni, best of Aṅgirases, best of ritual adepts, something dear to you might we speak—a winning sacred formulation. 3. Who is the kinsman of your peoples? O Agni, who holds the pious ceremony? Who are you and fixed in what? 4. You are the kinsman of the peoples. O Agni, you are the dear envoy, a comrade for your comrades, to be reverently invoked. 5. Sacrifice for us to Mitra and Varuṇa; sacrifice to the gods, to lofty truth. Agni, you will sacrifice to your own home.


1. What reverent approach is to your heart’s desire? What inspired thought will be the most beneficial, Agni? Or, who attains your skill through his sacrifices? Or, with what mind should we piously serve you? 202 I.77 2. Come hither, Agni; sit down here as Hotar. Become an undeceivable leader for us. Let the two world-halves, which set everything in motion, aid you. Sacrifice to the gods for great benevolence. 3. Burn away all demonic beings, Agni. Become for the sacrifices the protector from curses. Then convey here the lord of soma with his two fallow bays. We have made a guest reception for him who gives well. 4. With a speech bringing offspring you are to be invoked as the conveyor (of oblations) with your mouth, and you will sit down here with the gods. You pursue the Hotarship and the Potarship, you instrument of sacrifice. Become (all this), o provider and engenderer of goods. 5. Just as you sacrificed to the gods with the oblations of the inspired poet Manu, along with the poets, yourself a poet, even so, o Hotar most truly present, o Agni, today perform sacrifice with your gladdening tongue.


verb √ vī “pursue”


1. To you, o boundless Jātavedas, with a hymn do we Gotamas keep bellowing, with éclat. 2. And to you with a hymn does Gotama, desirous of wealth, show friendship. – We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat. 3. And to you, best winner of prizes, do we call, as Aṅgiras did. – We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat. 4. And to you, best smasher of obstacles, who send the Dasyus tumbling down, we keep bellowing, with éclat. 5.

Bring here to us wealth, o Agni, which is victorious in every way, worthy to be chosen, and difficult to surpass in all battles. 9.

The next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is in uṣṇih meter (8 8 12); the last four syllables of the third pāda are a semidetached refrain (“Indra indeed!”), so that the verses present themselves like gāyatrī (i.e., 8 8 8).


Although no strong unity among the various pieces of this hymn is perceptible, it does mimic in certain ways the progress of a soma sacrifice.


1. O Maruts of extensive might, certainly the man over whose dwelling place you keep protective watch from heaven, he has the best protector.


9. You whose strength is real—make it [=strength] manifest by your greatness. Smite the demon with your lightning. 10. Conceal the concealable darkness. Run over every rapacious one. Make the light that we desire.


1. Let auspicious ideas come here to us from all sides—undeceivable, uncircumscribable, bursting out— so that the gods will be (ready) to increase us always, will be our unfaltering protectors every day. 2. The auspicious benevolence of the gods is for those who aim straight; let the generosity of the gods roll down toward us. We have reverently approached the fellowship of the gods: let the gods lengthen our lifetime for us to live. 3. Them do we call upon with our age-old formal invocation [=nivid]: Bhaga, Mitra, Aditi, Skill unfailing, Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May well-portioned Sarasvatī create joy for us. 4. At this let the Wind blow us a remedy that is joy itself. At this (let) Mother Earth, at this (let) Father Heaven, 222 I.90 at this (let) the soma-pressing stones (be) joy itself. To this, o holy Aśvins, give ear. 5. The one who holds sway, the lord of the moving and the still, who quickens insight, do we call upon for help, so that Pūṣan will be (ready) to increase our possessions, will be a guardian, an undeceivable protector for our well-being. 6. Well-being for us (may) Indra of strengthened fame (establish); well-being for us (may) Pūṣan of all possessions; well-being for us (may) Tārkṣya of indestructible wheel-rims; well-being for us may Br̥haspati establish. 7. The Maruts having dappled horses, having Pr̥śni as mother, charging to beauty, coming regularly to the rites, the men having Agni as tongue and the Sun as eye: may all the gods come here to us with help. 8. Might we hear (only what is) auspicious with our ears, o gods; might we see (only what is) auspicious with our eyes, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice.

1. With straight guidance let Varuṇa, let Mitra the knowing guide us; let Aryaman jointly with the gods. 2. For they are goods-possessors of goods; unerring, they with their mighty powers guard the commandments everywhere. 3. They will extend shelter to us, the immortals to the mortals, thrusting away hatreds. 4. Let them clear out paths for us for easy passage—Indra, the Maruts, Pūṣan, Bhaga, (all those) to be extolled. 5. And (make) our poetic insights tipped with cows, o Pūṣan and Viṣṇu traveling your ways; make us possessed of well-being. 6. Honey do the winds (blow) to the one who follows truth; honey do the rivers stream. Honeyed be the plants for us. 7. Honey by night and at dawn; honeyed is the earthly realm. Honey be Father Heaven for us. 8. Honeyed be the tree for us, honeyed the sun. Honeyed be the cows for us. 9. Luck for us Mitra, luck Varuṇa; luck be Aryaman for us— Luck for us Indra and Br̥haspati; luck for us Viṣṇu of the wide strides.


10. Being born again and again though ancient, (always) beautifying herself to the same hue, like a successful (gambler) with the best throw who diminishes the stake (of his opponent), the goddess keeps diminishing the lifetime of the mortal as she ages him.


11. Uncovering the ends of heaven, she has awakened. She keeps her sister [=Night] far away. Diminishing human (life-)spans, the maiden radiates forth with the eye of her swain [=Sun].


śruṣṭimántam “having an attentive hearing”)


The collection is at a generally high level of poetic craftsmanship, but we will only single out for special mention 104, a challenging Indra hymn, 105, a famous and enigmatic All God hymn, and the lovely Dawn hymn 113. I.94 Agni


2. For whom you perform sacrifice, that one reaches his goal. Without assault he dwells in peace; he will acquire good heroes en masse. He is powerful; constraint does not reach him. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm. 3. Might we be able to kindle you. Send our insights to their goal. The gods eat the oblation poured in you. Convey the Ādityas here, for we are eager for them. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm.


1. For Jātavedas we will press soma. He will burn down the property of the hostile. He will carry us across all difficult passages, across difficult transits, as if with a boat across a river—Agni.


śrád-dhā “trust” in


mythic hero Āyu is the son of the Apsaras Urvaśī and the mortal king Purūravas, but his lot was cast with mortals when his mother abandoned him (see X.95), and in this sense his true origins have been, at the least, muddied. But there is a more positive aspect to this phrase; since he and the other Ārya continue to move forward into ever new territory, where they came from recedes into the background: their future is forward.


Have the poet’s fears been calmed after all? Has he really regained his faith in the efficacy of his own poetry and of the sacrifice they serve? Or will the wolf prey upon him again? The hymn leaves these questions open and in this way subtly and uninsistently undermines the reassuring structure of the poem and destabilizes its architecture. It is a masterful stroke.


1. Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, the Maruts’ troop, and Aditi do we call upon for help. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 2. O Ādityas, come here for our wholeness; o gods, become luck itself in the overcoming of obstacles. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 3. Let the Fathers help us, those good to proclaim, and the two goddesses [=Heaven and Earth], whose sons are the gods, strong through truth. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 4. Inciting the prizewinner Narāśaṃsa here—with appeals for grace we beg Pūṣan, who rules over heroes. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 5. O Br̥haspati, make easy passage for us always. The luck and lifetime of yours that was set in place by Manu—that we beg for. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 6. Kutsa the seer, squeezed down into a pit, called on Indra, smasher of Vr̥tra, lord of power, for help. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 7. Let goddess Aditi, with the gods, keep guard over us. Let the god Protector protect us, not keeping his distance. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


yád “when”


in the first two verses that he seeks a better state and must turn to Indra and Agni for help because his kin-group is unreliable. This is expressed in general terms in the first verse, but in bitter particulars in the second. Interestingly the deficient relatives in that verse are both connections through the female line: his daughter’s husband and his wife’s brother (the word syālá is specialized for this relationship). In a patrilocal system like that of ancient India, neither of them would have particularly close ties to him.

Notes: 1) i believe that he is saying in terms of pleasure one gets if his daughter is happy with her husband or the brother in law gives a lot of gifts or do not interefer in his life.it is more of mental peace and indra etc caan always offer better peace then them. 


Every day has a dawn and every day’s dawn is, in some sense, the same, while being quite distinct. Today’s dawn has been preceded by countless many and will be followed by countless many; she is both last and first. But she is also the capitalized and personified single Dawn.


1. These poetic thoughts do we proffer to Rudra, the powerful one with braided hair who rules over heroes, so that he will be luck for our two-footed and four-footed, so that everything in this settlement will be flourishing, free of affliction. 2. Be merciful to us, Rudra, and create joy for us. To you who rule over heroes we would do honor with reverence. Whatever luck and lifetime Father Manu won through sacrifice, that may we attain under your guidance, Rudra. 3. May we attain your benevolence though sacrifice to the gods, the benevolence of you who rule over heroes, o reward-granting Rudra. Bestowing only favor, come roaming toward our clans: possessing heroes who cannot be harmed, we will pour you an oblation. 266 I.115 4. We call down turbulent Rudra for help, the wandering poet who brings the sacrifice to success. In the distance from us let him shoot his divine anger. It is just his benevolence we choose. 5. We call down with reverence the boar of heaven, flame-red, with braided hair, turbulent in form. Bearing in his hand desirable healing remedies, he will extend shelter, covering, and protection to us. 6. This speech here is spoken to the father of the Maruts—speech sweeter than sweet, strengthening to Rudra. Both grant us, immortal one, what nourishes mortals, and be merciful to our selves, to our progeny and posterity. 7. Not the great one among us nor the wee little one, not the growing one among us nor the grown— don’t smite our father nor our mother. Don’t harm our own dear bodies, Rudra. 8. Don’t do harm to our progeny and posterity nor to our (own) lifespan, not to our cows nor to our horses. Don’t smite our heroes, Rudra, when enraged. We, with our oblations, will always invoke you. 9. Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you. Grant your favor to us, father of the Maruts, for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful. It is just your aid that we choose. 10. In the distance be your cow-smiting and men-smiting (anger). You who rule over heroes, let your favor be on us. Both be merciful to us and speak on our behalf, o god, and then extend double-lofty shelter to us. 11. We have spoken reverence to him, seeking his aid. Let Rudra, accompanied by the Maruts, hear our call. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


1. The brilliant face of the gods has arisen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni; he has filled heaven, earth, and the space between: the Sun is the life-breath of both the moving and the still.


6. Today, o gods, at the rising of the Sun, deliver us from distress and from disgrace. – This let Mitra and Varuıa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


“having twisted” ( právr̥kta)


1. What oblation to you will bring success, Aśvins? Who will be to the liking of you both? How will he make offering?—he, an inattentive man! 2. He should ask just the two [=the Aśvins] who know about the doors—he, the man who does not know properly, who later (would be) without insight. Never are the two inactive around the mortal. 280 I.121 3. We call upon you two knowing ones. Knowing, you should speak to us a (poetic) thought today. Distributing portions, the one seeking you chants forth. 4. In my naïvete﻿́ I ask (you), not (other) gods, about the unerring (soma), created with the vaṣaṭ-call, o wondrous ones. Protect us from the more powerful and the more violent one! 5. (The Speech that says,) “I who cry forth as if at the Bhr̥gavāna (fire), who am beautiful, I the Speech by which Pajriya [=Kakṣīvant] sacrifices to you”— seeking refreshment, (I do) not (cry) forth (such Speech) as one who knows. 6. Hear the song of Takavāna, even though I have rasped it out to you, Aśvins. (Set) your eyes here, lords of beauty, upon our home. 7. Because you two were in great joy surely (then) when you had jerked it away— o good ones, you should be fine herdsmen for us!—protect us from the ill-wishing wolf. 8. Do not betray us to a nobody (who is) our enemy. Do not let our cows go from our house to a nowhere place, giving sustenance from their udders, though without young. 9. She should give milk in order to establish an alliance with you two. Measure us for wealth accompanied by prizes of victory, and measure us for nourishment accompanied by cattle. 10. I have won the horseless chariot of the Aśvins with their prizewinning mares. By it I enjoy abundant delight. 11. In every way this easy-moving chariot will carry me again and again among the peoples, o body (of mine), to the soma-drinking. 12. So then, I take no account of a dream nor of a rich man who gives no sustenance. Both these vanish in the morning.


3. Let the earth-circling one [=Wind], rising at early morning, invigorate us. Let the Wind, (child?) of the waters, accompanied by bulls, invigorate us. Sharpen us, o Indra and “Mountain” [=Indra’s mace]. Let all the gods then create wide space for us.


I.123 Dawn Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa 13 verses: triṣṭubh One of the loveliest of the R̥gvedic Dawn hymns.


8. (Let) Indra (be) more and more preeminent among us with his self-glorious help in the shunning of bad thoughts—in the shattering of bad thoughts. She herself [=Bad Thought] is to be harmed who has sought us out with her devourers. She will be smashed, she will not wax strong—like a firebrand flung aside she will not wax strong.


1. Both world-halves I purify with truth; the deceits—great, but lacking Indra—I burn up entirely, where the enemies, having attacked, lay slain, crushed all around the Place of Hostility.


Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the I.139 311 shining forth”),


Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the I.139 311 shining forth”), who in later Vedic and even in late R̥gveda (Vālakh., VIII.52.1) is considered the father of Manu and who is often associated, as a proto-priest, with the pressing of soma. (His Avestan correspondent Vīvaŋuuaṇt is the first man who pressed haoma [Y 9.4].)


3. His are the dazzling, his the unaging radiant beams—he possessing a lovely appearance, a lovely face, a lovely flash. 320 I.144 The (beams) of Agni, with the energy of their radiance, are churning like rivers of the night, across (the nights), unsleeping, unaging.


8. Staying close, o Agni, protect us with your kindly, able protectors that stay close. With your undeceivable, undistracted, unwinking (protectors), o object of our quest, protect our kindred all around.


1. Ask him: he has come; he knows. As the one who perceives, he is implored; he is now implored here. In him are our commands, in him our wishes [/offerings]. He is the lord of the victory prize and of unbridled power. 2. Just him do they ask, but he himself does not ask in turn, since, like a clever man, with his own mind he has grasped it. He does not forget the first nor the later word. Undistracted, he is accompanied by his resolve. 3. Just to him go the offering ladles; to him the mares [=streams of ghee?]. He alone will hear all my words. Enjoining many ritual commands, triumphant, bringing the sacrifice to success, offering uninterrupted help, (though) a child, he has taken on his ferocity entirely. 4. He proceeds in a reverential approach (to them) when they [=flames?] have raised themselves up together. Just born, he has crept together with the conjoined ones. He touches the swelling one for joy and delight, when the willing females [=streams of ghee?] go to him standing right there. 5. This wild beast of the waters that roams in the woods has been installed upon the uppermost skin. He has declared the (ritual) patterns to mortals—the knowing Agni. For he is the perceiver of truth who is really present (here).

Notes: 1) the uppermost skin can be our uppermost layer our exposure to the outside world.the fire of greed etc starts from there.agni has toldusso anditsuptous to be. 


4. O Agni, the ungenerous one wishing us ill and full of hostility who harms us by his duplicity, let this heavy spell be back at him: he should bring harm upon his own body by his evil words. 5. Or, o strong one, the mortal who with premeditation harms a mortal by his duplicity, from him protect your praiser, o you who are praised. Agni, no one should give us over to distress.


One of the only hymns dedicated entirely to Viṣṇu,


Likewise, the description of the Aśvins’ sending fire and water into the trees (vs. 6) refers to the water, which not only allows the trees to grow but also carries fire that emerges when wood is kindled.


1. Agni has awakened; the Sun rises from the earth; great, glowing Dawn has dawned widely with her ray of light. The Aśvins have harnessed their chariot to make their journey. The god Savitar has spurred the living world in all directions.


4. Carry nourishment to us, Aśvins, and mix us with your honeyed whip. Extend our lifetime, wipe away our diseases, repel hatred, and be companions to us.


12. When, having shut your eyes, you crept around the living worlds, where were your loving parents? I.162 343 You cursed him who took your arm. Who made a declaration (to you), to him you also made a declaration. 13. After you slept, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Who awakened us here, o Agohya?” The billy-goat [=the Sun?] said the dog [=the Moon?] was the awakener. Here today, after a year, you opened your eyes. 14. The Maruts travel through heaven, Agni along the earth; the Wind here travels through the midspace; Varuṇa travels through the waters and seas—seeking you, o sons of strength. The


ritual (adhiyajñam) and to the world (adhidevatam),


human body or the human being (adhyātmam).


1. This treasured one, the gray Hotar—his middle brother is the ravenous one; his third brother is the one with ghee-smeared back. In him I saw the clanlord with his seven sons. 2. The seven harness the chariot with a single wheel [=the Sun]. A single horse with seven names draws it. Triple-naved [=with three seasons?] is the unaging, unassailable wheel, on which all these living beings rest. 3. As its seven horses, the seven [=the priests] who stand upon this chariot [=the sacrifice] draw the seven-wheeled (chariot). Seven sisters [=voices of the priests] together cry out (the words) in which the seven names of the cows [=poetic speech] are imprinted. 4. Who has seen the first one [=the Sun/Agni] as he is being born, when his boneless (mother) [=the Waters?] carries the one having bones [=the one who is a living being]? Where is the life, blood, and breath of the earth? Who will approach the knowing one to ask this? I.164 355 5. Naïve, not understanding, in my mind I ask about these imprinted tracks of the gods. Upon the full-grown calf [=the fire] the poets have stretched the seven warp-threads (of the sacrifice) in order to weave. 6. Unperceptive, I ask also the perceptive poets about this in order to know, since I am unknowing: What also is the One in the form of the Unborn [=the Sun] that has propped apart these six realms (of heaven and earth)? 7. Let him speak here, who knows the imprinted track of this treasured bird [=the Sun]. The cows [=rain clouds] yield milk [=rain] from his head [=the Sun]. Clothing themselves in a cloak, they have drunk water with the foot [=the Sun’s rays]. 8. The mother [=Dawn] gave her father [=the Sun/Heaven] a share in the truth, for in the beginning, through her insight, she united (with him) by her mind. Recoiling, she whose essence was her child [=Agni/the Sun] was pierced (by her father). Just those offering their reverence went to the (morning) invocation. 9. The mother was harnessed to the yoke-pole of the sacrificial reward; her child stood up amid the penned cows. The calf [=Agni] bellowed and looked toward the cow of every color [=Dawn], three wagon-treks (in the distance). 10. Carrying three mothers [=earths] and three fathers [=heavens] alone, he [=the Sun] stands upright: they do not cause him to weary. On the back of yonder heaven they [=the gods] recite the speech that knows everything but does not inspire everyone. 11. Twelve-spoked, the wheel of truth [=the Sun] ever rolls around heaven—yet not to old age. Upon it, o Agni, stand seven hundred twenty sons in pairs [=the nights and days of the year]. 12. They speak of the father [=the Moon] with five feet [=the seasons] and twelve forms [=the months], the overflowing one in the upper half of heaven. But these others speak of the far-gazing one [=the Sun] in the nearer (half) fixed on (the chariot) with seven wheels [=the Sun, Moon, and visible planets] and six spokes [=the seasons, in a different reckoning]. 13. In the five-spoked wheel [=the year] that rolls round—on that do all living beings take their stand. Its axle does not become hot, though its load is heavy. From of old it, along with its nave, does not break apart. 356 I.164 14. Along with its felly, the unaging wheel [=the night Sun] has turned away. Harnessed to the outstretched (yoke-pole) [=the airy realm?], ten (horses) draw it. Covered over, the eye of the Sun moves through the airy realm. All living beings are fixed upon it. 15. They speak of the seventh of those who are born at the same time as the one born alone, saying, “the twins, the Seers born of the gods, are only six.” What (places) are desired by these [=the Seven Seers] are distributed according to their spheres. While (the one) [=the pole star] stands still, the ones varied in appearance [=the stars of the Seven Seers] quiver. 16. Though they [=the Kr̥ttikās, the Pleiades] are women, yet they speak of them as men to me. He who has eyes sees; the blind man does not differentiate. One who is a poet, a (poet’s) son, perceives them. One who recognizes these (women), he will be the father of his father. 17. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here [=at the horizon], the cow [=Dawn] carrying her calf [=the Sun] has stood up by her foot. In which direction is she? Toward which side did she go away? Where does she give birth, for it is not within the fold? 18. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here is he [=the Sun] who knows his father. Showing himself to be a poet, who will proclaim this here: from whence has divine thought been born? 19. What (chariots [=sacrifices?] come) this way—they say that those (will go) away; what (chariots go) away—they say that those (will come) this way. O Soma and Indra, (the deeds) that you two have done, these draw (those chariots) like (horses) harnessed to the yoke-pole of the airy realm. 20. Two well-feathered (birds), yokemates and companions, embrace the same tree. Of those two the one eats the sweet fig; the other, not eating, keeps watch. 21. Where the well-feathered (birds), never blinking, cry out for a share of immortality and for the ritual distributions, here the forceful herdsman of the whole living world, the insightful one, has entered me, the naïve one. 22. Just that tree on which all the honey-eating, well-feathered ones settle and give birth, they say, has the sweet fig at its top. He who does not know the father will not reach up to that. I.164 357 23. How the gāyatrī (track) [=gāyatrī line] is based upon a gāyatrī (hymn) or how a triṣṭubh (track) [=triṣṭubh line] was fashioned out of a triṣṭubh (hymn), or how the jagat track [=jagatī line] is based on the jagat [=jagatī] (hymn)—only those who know this have reached immortality. 24. By the gāyatrī (track) [=line] one measures the chant; by the chant the melody; by the triṣṭubh (track) [=line] (one measures) the recitation; by the two-footed and the four-footed recitation the (full) recitation. By the syllable the seven voices assume their measure. 25. By the jagat [=jagatī] (stanza) he buttressed the river in heaven; in the rathantara (chant), he watched over the Sun. They say that there are three kindling sticks [=three lines in a gāyatrī stanza] belonging to the gāyatrī (stanza). By its greatness it [=the gāyatrī stanza] has passed beyond those in greatness. 26. I summon this milk-cow giving good milk, and the deft-handed milker will milk her. Savitar will impel the most excellent impetus in us. The gharma pot has been heated: this shall I proclaim. 27. Making the sound hiṅ, the goods-mistress of goods, seeking her calf, has come near through (my) thinking. Let this inviolable cow give milk to the Aśvins. Let her increase for our great good fortune. 28. The cow bellowed after her blinking calf. She made the sound hiṅ against his head (for him) to bellow. Lowing toward his hot jaw, she bellows her bellow and swells her swell of milk. 29. This hums—that by which the cow is enclosed. She bellows her bellow, resting upon the smoky (fire). Because she has put down (what is) mortal with the sound “chit-chit,” becoming lightning, she pushed away her covering. 30. Breathing, life rests (though remaining) on its headlong course, stirring (though) steadfast in the midst of the dwelling places. The living one keeps moving by the will of the dead one; the immortal one shares the same womb with the mortal one. 31. I saw the herdsman who never settles down, roaming here and afar along his paths. Clothing himself in those that converge and diverge, he moves back and forth among living beings. 32. He who created him does not know him. He is far away from him who has seen him. He is surrounded within the womb of his mother. Having many offspring, he has entered into destruction. 358 I.164 33. [The Sun:] “My father, my progenitor, is Heaven; here is my navel. My mother, this great Earth, is my relation. My womb is within the two open cups [=Heaven and Earth]. Here my father placed the child [=the Sun] of his daughter [=Dawn].” 34. I ask you about the farthest end of the earth. I ask where is the navel of the living world. I ask you about the seed of the bull(-like) horse. I ask about the highest heaven of speech. 35. This altar here is the farthest end of the earth. This sacrifice here is the navel of the living world. This soma here is the seed of the bull(-like) horse. This formulator here is the highest heaven of speech. 36. The seven children of the (two world-)halves [=the Seven Seers], the seed of the living world, take their place by the direction of Viṣṇu in the spreading expanse. By their insights and their thought these encompassing perceivers of inspired words encompass (everything) everywhere. 37. I do not understand what sort of thing I am here: though bound, I roam about in secret by my thinking. When the first-born of truth [=Agni] has come to me, only then do I attain a share of this speech here. 38. He goes inward and outward, controlled by his own will—he, the immortal one of the same womb as the mortal one. Those two are ever going apart in different directions. They observe the one; they do not observe the other. 39. The syllable of the verse, upon which all the gods have settled, is in the highest heaven— he who does not know that (syllable), what will he accomplish by his verse? Only those who know it sit together here. 40. Because you would become blessed, feeding upon good pasturage, so then we would also be blessed. Feed on grass always, o inviolable cow [=Speech]! Coming here, drink pure water! 41. The buffalo-cow [=Speech] has bellowed, fashioning oceans. One-footed and two-footed, she is four-footed, having become eight-footed and nine-footed: she has a thousand syllables in the highest heaven. 42. Seas flow everywhere from her: by that the four directions live, from that the syllable flows, upon that does everything live. 43. At the midpoint, beyond this nearer (fire), I saw dung-smoke from afar. Heroes cooked the dappled bullock. These were the first foundations (of the rite). I.164 359 44. Three long-haired ones gaze out in succession: in a year one [=Agni] of them shears away (the land) for himself; another [=the Sun] gazes upon everything with his powers; the rush of another [=Wind] is visible, but not his form. 45. Speech is measured in four feet [/quarters]. Brahmins of inspired thinking know these. They do not set in motion the three that are imprinted in secret; the sons of Manu speak the fourth (foot/quarter) of speech. 46. They say it is Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni, and also it is the winged, well-feathered (bird) of heaven [=the Sun]. Though it is One, inspired poets speak of it in many ways. They say it is Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan. 47. Along the dark course, tawny well-feathered (birds) [=flames], clothing themselves in the waters, fly up toward heaven. These have returned here (as rain) from the seat of truth [=heaven]. Only then is the earth moistened with ghee. 48. The chariot-wheel (of the Sun) is one, its wheel-segments are twelve, its wheel-naves are three: who understands this? They [=the days] that wander on and on are fitted together on that, like three hundred pegs, like sixty (more). 49. Your breast, which is ever full, which is joy itself, by which you make all desirable things prosper, which confers treasure and finds wealth, which brings good gifts—o Sarasvatī, you prepare that to suckle us here. 50. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice: these were the first foundations. These, its greatnesses, followed to heaven’s vault, where the ancient Sādhyas and the gods are. 51. This water remains the same: it goes up and down throughout the days. Thunderstorms vivify the earth, and fires vivify heaven. 52. The heavenly well-feathered, lofty bird, child of the waters, and beautiful (child) of the plants, the one bringing satisfaction by the rains from what is bounded by waters: Sarasvant!—him do I call upon again and again for help.


Kutsa, the horses of the Wind,

Notes: 1)  man is swifter than mind.it travels in three directions....past.present.future.it takes us to dwelling of gods. 


1. Harness that which is swifter than mind, which has a triple chariot-box and three wheels, o bulls, with which you drive right up to the dwelling of the good performer (of rituals). You fly with the tripartite (chariot) like a bird with its feathers. 2. The smooth-rolling chariot rolls on as it goes toward earth, when you stand on it, resolved to fortify (us). Let this hymn here accompany the wonder with wonderment; you keep company with Dawn, the Daughter of Heaven. 3. Mount your smooth-rolling chariot, the one providing the oblations that rolls on according to your commandments, by which you two, o Nāsatyas, superior men, drive your circuit for our descendants and ourselves to prosper. 4. Let neither the wolf nor the she-wolf venture against you. Do not avoid (us) nor pass (us) by. Here is the portion deposited for you, here the hymn, o wondrous ones, and here the deposits of honey for you. 5. Gotama, Purumīḍha, Atri—(each one), providing the oblations, summons you two for help, o wondrous ones. Like those going in a straight line to the directed direction, drive here to my summons, o Nāsatyas. 6. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness. A praise hymn has been set out in response to you, o Aśvins. Drive just here along the paths leading to the gods. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. Which of these two is the earlier, and which the later? How were they born, o poets? Who fully understands? By themselves the two carry everything that is a name. Day and Night roll through (them) like two wheels. 2. The two, unmoving and footless, conceive an ample embryo, moving and footed, like a natural son in the lap of his parents. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 3. I invoke the gift of Aditi, which is without fault, without aggression, without weapon, and provided with sunlight and reverence. O you two world-halves, beget it for the singer. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 4. We should be devoted to the two who are never scorched, (always) giving help with their help, to the two world-halves whose children are the gods, to the pair among the gods, along with the pairs among the days. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 5. The two young women, sisters, siblings [=Night and Dawn?], contiguous and uniting with each other in the lap of their parents, sniff-kissing the navel of the world. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 6. The two broad and lofty seats do I invoke with truth, the begetters of the gods with their help, they of lovely countenance who conceive the immortal one. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 7. The two, broad and wide, voluminous and of distant boundary, do I address with homage in this sacrifice, who, bringing good fortune and advancing well, conceive (the embryo). – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 8. If we have ever committed any offence at all against the gods or against a comrade or against the lord of the family, this hymnic vision should be propitiation to them. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 9. Let both lauds belonging to men help me; let both (Heaven and Earth) accompany me with aid, with help. There is much for him who gives even more than the stranger. Becoming exhilarated by the refreshment, might we be refreshed, o gods. 10. I of good wisdom have spoken this truth to Heaven and to Earth to hear first. Let the two of them protect from disgrace and difficulty in close quarters. Let the mother and father guard (us) with their help. 390 I.186 11. Let this come true, Heaven and Earth, which I address to you two, o Father and Mother. Become the nearest of the gods with your help. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. Now I shall praise food, the support and power of the great, by whose might Trita shook Vr̥tra apart till his joints were parted. 2. O sweet food, honeyed food, we have chosen you: for us be a helper. 3. Draw near to us, food—kindly with your kindly help, joy itself, not to be despised, a very kind companion without duplicity. 4. These juices of yours, food, are dispersed throughout the realms, adjoined to heaven like the winds. 5. These (juices) are those that yield you, o food, and they also are part of you, sweetest food. Those who receive the sweetness of your juices press forward like strong-necked (bulls). 6. On you, food, is the mind of the great gods set. A dear (deed) was done at your signal: he smashed the serpent with your help. 7. When yonder dawning light of the mountains has come, o food, then you should also come here to us, honeyed food, fit for our portion. 8. When we bite off a full share of the waters and plants, o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 9. When we take a share of you when mixed with milk or mixed with grain, o Soma, o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 10. Become the gruel, o plant, the fat, the steaming [?] suet [?], o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 11. We have sweetened you with words, o food, as cows [=milk] (do) the oblations— you as feasting companion for the gods, you as feasting companion for us.


1. O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path, since you know all the (ritual) patterns, o god. Keep from us transgression, going its crooked way. Might we offer you the greatest expression of reverence. 2. O Agni, deliver us anew to the far shore, beyond all hardships, with your blessings. And become a wide fortress, thick and broad, for us, and luck and lifetime for our progeny and posterity. 3. O Agni, keep from us afflictions, (so) they will afflict peoples without Agni’s protection. Renew the earth for us to go easily upon it, o god worthy of the sacrifice, along with all the immortals. 4. Protect us, Agni, with your unwearying protectors, and when you blaze here in your own dear seat. Let not fear find your singer, neither now nor later, o youngest mighty one. 5. Do not release us, Agni, to the evil man, nor to the greedy one, the cheat, nor to misfortune. Do not hand us over to the toothed one who bites nor to the toothless, nor to one who does harm, o strong one. 6. One like you, o Agni born of truth, when hymned, will stretch wide a shield for our body I.190 395 from everyone who seeks to harm or to revile—for you watch widely over crooked ways, o god. 7. Distinguishing between the two [=sacrificers and non-sacrificers?], you pursue the sons of Manu at the early mealtime, o Agni worthy of the sacrifice. At the later mealtime you become tractable for Manu, to be groomed like a foal [?] by the fire-priests. 8. We have spoke enigmas in his presence—I, the son of Māna, (have spoken them) in the presence of mighty Agni. May we win a thousand together with the seers. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. With chants I will strengthen anew the unassailable bull of gladdening tongue, Br̥haspati, the brightly shining leader of song to whom the gods and the mortals harken as he bellows.


I.191 Against Poisonous Animals Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi


Brahmaṇaspati or Br̥haspati, the “lord of the sacred formulation”


Noteworthy among them are II.33, one of only three hymns in the R̥gveda to Rudra, II.35, the only hymn in the R̥gveda dedicated to Apām Napāt, the “Child of the Waters,” and II.38, a hymn to Savitar that shows his role as the god of the evening who brings the world to rest.


The effect of this incantatory repetition of “you, Agni,” taking place in front of the sacrificial fire on the ritual ground, combined with the sweep of equations identifying Agni with what comes to seem like everything on earth and in heaven, is to concentrate all of the cosmos into this small space, the sacrifical ground, and this single entity, the sacrificial fire—indeed making the sacrificial microcosm the equivalent of the macrocosm. The ordering of the identifications—starting and ending at the sacrifice, but in between ranging through both the divine and human realms—models the centrality of the sacrifice and of its focus, the sacred fire. It is a powerful beginning to the maṇḍala and to the Family Books in general.


1. You, Agni, (are born) throughout the days, you who are eager to blaze here; you (are born) from the waters, you from the stone, you from the trees, you from the plants, you, men-lord of men, are born blazing. 2. Yours, Agni, is the office of Hotar; yours that of Potar in its turn; yours that of Neṣṭar; you are the Agnidh [=Fire-Kindler] of the one who follows truth. Yours is the office of Praśāstar; you act as Adhvaryu; you are both the Brahman-priest and the houselord in our home. 3. You, Agni, as bull of beings, are Indra; you, wide-going, worthy of homage, are Viṣṇu. You, o lord of the sacred formulation, finder of wealth, are the Brahman [=Formulator]; you, o Apportioner, are accompanied by Plenitude. 4. You, Agni, whose commandments are steadfast, are King Varuṇa; you, wondrous to be invoked, become Mitra. You, as the lord of settlements who (offers) a common meal, are Aryaman; you, apportioning at the ritual distribution, o god, are Aṃśa [/Share]. 5. You, Agni, (giving wealth) rich in heroes to the one who does honor, are Tvaṣṭar—yours is kinship, o you accompanied by the Wives (of the Gods) and possessing Mitra’s might— You have given (wealth) rich in horses as the impeller of swift (horses) [=Child of the Waters]. You of many goods are the troop of men [=Maruts]. 6. You, Agni, as lord of great heaven, are Rudra; you, as the troop of Maruts, are master of strengthening nourishment [=rain]. You, as luck for livestock, drive with the ruddy winds (as horses); you, as Pūṣan, protect the ones doing honor, in your own person. 402 II.1 7. You, Agni, are Wealth-Giver to the preparer (of the offering); you, as the conferrer of treasure, are god Savitar. You, lord of men, as Bhaga [/Fortune] are master of goods; you are a protector in the house of him who has done you honor. 8. Toward you, Agni, as clanlord in the house do the clans stretch out straight—toward you, the king, easy to find. You, lovely-faced one, are lord over all; you are the counter(part) to thousands, hundreds, tens. 9. To you, Agni, as father, (do) men (approach) with their desires—to you, for brotherhood, (do they approach) with their (ritual) labor, you who are bright in body. You become the son of him who has done you honor; you as affectionate comrade—protect (him) from assault. 10. You, Agni, as [R̥bhu/] the craftsman at hand, are to be rendered homage; you are master of the cattle-rich prize [/Vāja], of wealth. You radiate widely [/(are) Vibhvan]: burn through to giving! You seek to carve up and to stretch out the sacrifice. 11. You, god Agni, are Aditi for the pious; you, as Hotrā Bhāratī, are strengthened by song. You are Iḍā, bestowing a hundred winters in return for skill; you, o lord of goods, as obstacle-smasher, are Sarasvatī. 12. You, Agni, when well kept, are highest vigor. In your coveted color there are beauties in sight. You are the prize, furthering and lofty; you are wealth, ample, broad on all sides. 13. You, Agni, did the Ādityas make their mouth; you did the pure ones make their tongue, o poet. You do the Gift-Escorts escort in the ceremonies; in you do the gods eat the poured oblation. 14. O Agni, through your mouth do all the undeceptive immortals, the gods, eat the oblation poured into you. With you the mortals sweeten their pressed drink. You, as embryo of the plants, were born blazing. 15. You are both equal and a counter(part) to these by your might, and, o Agni, well-born god, you surpass them, since your strengthening nourishment here extends in its greatness through heaven and earth, through both world-halves. 16. The patrons—those who dispatch to the praisers a gift tipped with cows and ornamented with horses, o Agni— lead both us and them forth to a better state. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.


4. Become our bounteous patron, o lord of goods who gives goods. Keep hatreds away from us.


6. May we be accompanied by the help of Agni, of Indra, of Soma, of (all) the gods— not suffering harm. May we surmount those who do battle.


2. You are the messenger, and you are our protector afar; you, bull, are our leader to a better (state). O Agni, for the prolonging of our progeny and of our own selves, become, as you shine, a herdsman who does not stay away.


ūrvá, the “containers,”


Note that śate﻿́na “with a hundred” is the hundredth word of the hymn.


But it is reflected also in mortals’ efforts: men contend to win the sun (vs. 4d), and the sacrificers strive to win as if in a race (vs. 7).


1. We call upon you, the troop-lord of troops, the most famous poet of poets, the preeminent king of sacred formulations, o lord of the sacred formulation. Hearing us, sit down upon your seat together with your help.


“he will win against those who seek to win” ( vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ)


11. I see far neither to the right nor to the left, neither forward nor behind, Ādityas. Be it in naïveté or in wisdom, you good ones, led by you, might I attain the light free from fear.


14. O Aditi, Mitra, and Varuṇa, have mercy if we have committed any offense against you. Might I reach the broad light that is free of fear, Indra. Let the long darkness (of death) not reach us.


This is the only hymn to Varuṇa alone in Maṇḍala II,


5. Loosen my offense from me like a halter. We would succeed in reaching the wellspring of your truth, Varuṇa. Let my thread not be cut as I weave my insight. Let not the full measure of my work be broken before its season.


6. Unfasten fear from me, o Varuṇa! Hold me close, o truth-possessing, universal king! Like a rope from a calf, untie confining straits (from me), for I cannot be away from you even for the blink of an eye.


6. Unfasten fear from me, o Varuṇa! Hold me close, o truth-possessing, universal king! Like a rope from a calf, untie confining straits (from me), for I cannot be away from you even for the blink of an eye. 7. (Strike) us not with your deadly weapons, o Varuṇa, which, in your hunt (for him), injure the one who commits an offense, o lord! Let us not go from light into foreign lands! Loosen our lapses for us to live!


of an eye.


11. Let me not find the lack of a dear benefactor, of a friend with many gifts, o Varuṇa. Let me not descend from wealth easy to control, o king. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.


2. You, gods, are solicitude; you are strength; you—keep hatreds far away. As apportioners, be indulgent and be merciful to us, both today and for the future. 3. What shall we do now with your future (friendship), what, good ones, with your old friendship? You—Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aditi, Indra and the Maruts—establish well-being for us. 4. Hail, gods: only you are our friends. Be merciful to me who am in need. Let our chariot not come to be without you when it is travelling in the middle (of battle/a journey?); let us not become weary while we have friends like you. 5. I alone have perpetrated a great offense against you, for which you have chastised me, like a father (his son, who is) a gambler. In the distance (be) your fetters, in the distance evils, o gods; do not seize


me in my son, like a bird.


“those seeking fame” ( śravasyávaḥ)


II.33 (224) Rudra Gr̥tsamada 15 verses: triṣṭubh Although under his transferred epithet Śiva (“kindly one”), Rudra has a grand career ahead of him in post-Vedic Hinduism, his role in Vedic, especially early Vedic, is relatively restrained. Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi- cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe- cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand, he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows, at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and of good luck.


Śiva (“kindly one”),


Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi- cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe- cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand, he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows, at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and of good luck.


This is the only R̥gvedic hymn devoted to the divinity Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters,” though he is mentioned on a number of occasions elsewhere in the text. This divine name is also found identically in Avestan, but in the R̥gveda it is in the course of becoming an epithet of Agni.


the rule of maṇḍala organization, whereby hymns within a single group contain descending number of verses.


According to Falk, in the second millennium BCE on this night the Milky Way rose from the horizon at dusk. The arc of the Milky Way, he says, was pictured as the outstretched arms of Savitar. Be that as it may, most of the images in the hymn are applicable to evening in general.


1. God Savitar has stood up to impel again as always—the draft-horse whose work this is— II.38 457 for now he distributes treasure to the gods, and he has also given a share in well-being to him whose oblations are worth pursuing. 2. Because the god, erect and with broad hands, extends his arms for all to obey, even the waters are submissive to his commandment and even this wind here rests in its circling. 3. Even the one who drives with swift (horses) will now unhitch. He has brought to rest even the wanderer from his travelling. He has held in check the greed even of the snake-stickers [?] . Following the commandment of Savitar, “Release” [=Evening] has come. 4. Once again the weaver has wrapped up what was stretched out; in the middle of his work the mindful (worker) has set down his craft. Having pulled himself together, he [=Savitar] has stood up. He has always kept the seasons separate. As Proper Thinking, god Savitar has come. 5. The domestic blaze of fire is dispersed prominently throughout the houses, one for each, for (each one’s) whole lifetime. The mother has set out the best portion for her son, according to his intention, which has been aroused by Savitar. 6. (Whatever) was dispersed seeking gain has been gathered together. Desire for home has arisen in all who roam. Each and every one has come, abandoning unfinished work, following the commandment of the divine Savitar. 7. The watery (race) has been placed by you among the waters; the wild beasts have been dispersed throughout the wastelands, as their share; the forests are for birds. No one violates these commandments of god Savitar. 8. As far as (Savitar’s) benefit extends, Varuṇa (has come) to his watery womb, restlessly darting about at (every) blink (of the eye). Every mortal creature, (every) domestic beast has come to its pen. Savitar has distributed the races according to their stations. 9. Whose commandment neither Indra nor Varuṇa, neither Mitra nor Aryaman, nor Rudra violates, nor do hostile powers—for well-being I call him here with homage: god Savitar. 10. As (we) arouse Fortune, Insight, and Plenitude—Praise of Men, the husband of the Wives, should help us— might we be dear to god Savitar at the approach of a desirable thing and at the gathering of riches. 11. That desirable benefit given by you has come to us from heaven, from the waters, from earth, (a benefit) that will become weal for your praisers and your friend, the singer whose recitations extend widely, o Savitar.

The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi- bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son of Kata Vaiśvāmitra.


The hymn to Mitra is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra.


The hymn to Mitra is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra. The last hymn (62) is a collection of tr̥cas to six different deities or pairs of deities, including some not otherwise represented in the maṇḍala. The hymn would not be especially noteworthy, except that verse 10, dedicated to Savitar, is the Gāyatrī mantra, the best-known verse in the R̥gveda.

Vipāś and Śutudrī Rivers. The poet approaches the Rivers and asks them to stop in order to allow the Bhāratas to cross. These two rivers are the modern Beas and Sutlej,


In verse 10 Agni gives rise to Agni, and therefore Agni is also his own father. But then who is the father in verse 9? Geldner and Renou think that his father there is Heaven, Heaven’s udder the raincloud, and therefore the fire here is lightning. More likely, however, the reference is to the ritual fire.


Vaiśvānara, the sun.


Agni’s semen ( rétas) that “flows on high.” First, rétas is both present in pāda d and suggested by √ rī “ flow” in pāda b. Second, that which is “flowing on high” in pādas ab results in Agni’s birth in cd. Finally, the ellipsis of the object, which occurs between br̥hád / áriṇād, is solved in pāda d by bhū́ri-retasā “having abundant semen,” which echoes br̥hád / áriṇād phonologically and thereby suggests “semen” as the missing object. The mystery also brings back the theme of the Agni as sun and as sacrificial fire, since the fire who is single and who makes semen flow on high is likely the sun.

III.31 (265) Indra Kuśika Aiṣīrathi or Viśvāmitra Gāthina 22 verses: triṣṭubh This dense and often puzzling hymn has given rise to much discussion. The heart of the hymn (vss. 4–11 and passim throughout the rest of the hymn) provides one 508 III.31 of the fullest accounts in the R̥gveda of the Vala myth and especially of Indra and the Aṅgirases as they besiege the Vala cave and seek to free the cows within by means of song and ritual activity.

It is an extraordinarily focused hymn, and its apparent simplicity may result not from artlessness, but from careful pruning.


1. For Vr̥tra-smashing capacity and for victory in battle— Indra—we turn you hither. 2. Let the cantors make your mind inclined our way— Indra of a hundred resolves—and your eye as well. 3. We implore your names with all our songs— Indra of a hundred resolves—in vanquishing hostility. 4. We magnify (him) through the hundred embodiments of the much-praised one, of Indra, the supporter of the settled domains. 5. Indra, much invoked, I call toward me to slay Vr̥tra, to win spoils in raids. 6. Be victorious when the prize (is set). We implore you, Indra of a hundred resolves, to slay Vr̥tra. 7. Amid brilliant outbursts on the battle-drive, amid claims to fame that bring success in battles, Indra, be victorious at the hostilities. 8. Drink the most unbridled, brilliant, wakeful soma— Indra of a hundred resolves—to aid us. 9. Your Indrian powers that are among the five peoples— Indra of a hundred resolves—those I want for myself. III.38 521 10. You have come, Indra, to lofty fame. Establish for yourself brilliance difficult to surpass. We exalt your unbridled power. 11. From nearby come here to us—also, able one, from afar. The broad space that is yours—Indra possessor of the stone—from that come here.

1. I will proclaim great Indra, toward whom all the soma-drinking communities have directed their desire, the very resolute one, fashioned for distinction, whom the two Holy Places [=Heaven and Earth] and the gods begot as the bane of obstacles. 2. The most manly sovereign king, mounted on fallow bays, whom now as before no one overcomes in battles, who along with his warriors is strongest through our fortifying (hymns). He in his broad expansion curtailed the lifetime of the Dasyu. 3. Victorious in battles like an overtaking steed, traversing the two world-halves, streaming abundance. Like Bhaga at the decisive moment, he is to be invoked with thoughts; like a father, he is dear, easy to invoke, conferring vigor. 4. As supporter of heaven, of the dusky realm, he is inquired after; erect like a chariot, he is (like) Vāyu teamed with goods. III.50 533 Illuminator of the nights, generator of the sun, he distributes the share, like the Holy Place [=ritual ground] the prize. 5. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory, the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

Svarbhānu, literally “he who possesses the radiance of the sun,” is actu- ally the Sun’s earthly counterpart, the god Agni. He punished the Sun for the lat- ter’s incestuous intercourse with his daughter (not mentioned in this hymn, but frequently found elsewhere), but because of the importance of sunlight for the maintenance of the world, the Sun had to be restored by the seer Atri (also the supposed poet of this hymn) through ritual means. The physical manifestations of the Sun’s punishment betray his attacker’s identity: “pierced with darkness” refers to sunspots, dark spots on the sun as if burnt by fire, and the enveloping darkness of smoke is depicted in verse 6.


The following series of hymns to the All Gods / All the Gods (V.41–51) contains some of the most complex and difficult poetry in the R̥gveda (along with some rest- fully more straightforward hymns), including the hymn that Geldner called “the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda” (“das schwierigste Lied des R̥V”), V.44. Although the placement of this series within the Saṃhitā was dictated by the strict and mechani- cal rules of numerical arrangement discussed before (see Intro. pp. 10–11), it is sometimes difficult for us not to view this set of hymns as a type of omphalos in the larger structure of the R̥gveda. They are found in more or less the middle of Maṇḍala V (which has 87 hymns), which is more or less the middle maṇḍala of the Family Books (II–VII—keeping in mind that, though V is preceded by three maṇḍalas and followed by two, the preceding maṇḍalas are shorter: II–IV contain 163 hymns, VI–VII 179, remarkably close to equivalence). Just as the omphalos verse in a hymn contains the enigma, the mysterious message of the hymn, so we could view these All God hymns as the mystical center of the older R̥gveda.


15. May this praise reach up to the Marutian troop, to the youthful sons of Rudra. Desire calls me to wealth with well-being. Praise the unruly ones with dappled horses. 16. May this praise reach to earth, to the midspace, to the trees, to the plants, for wealth. Let every god be easy for me to invoke. Let Mother Earth not set us in disfavor. 17. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods. 18. May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy itself and provides good guidance. Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here all that brings good fortune.


16. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods.

Notes: 1) for it will give us knowledge not only from our own past but also from those who took us from darkness to light; since time is space and space time.  


As noted above, Geldner considers this the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda


verse 1 represents an argument in favor of the new model of sacrifice including the Sacrificer’s Wife—then the lists of gods that follow might be a form of insurance.

Notes: 1) this is almost mid hyme of rigveda. 


1. Hitching up, she comes from heaven, she who is called the great mother of the Daughter (of Heaven [=Dawn]), waking (men), seeking to win, the youthful one, (coming) from the fathers, constantly calling in the seat (of the sacrifice)—(she is) Inspiration.


5. Here is the wonder, the enigma, people: that the rivers move, but the waters stay, that two, other than his mother, bear him—the two were born hither and yon but are twins, of the same lineage: (Sun and Agni).


1. I hasten toward god Savitar for you today, and toward Bhaga who apportions the treasure of Āyu. I would also turn hither you two superior men, who bring many enjoyments—seeking companionship with you, o Aśvins, day after day.


11. Well-being let the Aśvins, let Fortune mete out to us; well-being let the goddess Aditi, let the unassailable ones. Well-being let lord Pūṣan establish for us; well-being let Heaven and Earth, with kind attention. 12. For well-being we shall call upon Vāyu, on Soma; well-being (let him mete out) who is lord of creation. On Br̥haspati with his whole flock (we shall call) for well-being. For well-being let the Ādityas be there for us. 13. Let all the gods be there for us today, for well-being; let Vaiśvānara, Vasu, Agni (be there) for well-being. Let the gods, the R̥bhus give aid for (our) well-being. With well-being let Rudra protect us from constraint. 14. Well-being, o Mitra and Varuṇa, well-being, o rich Path. Well-being for us (let) Indra and Agni—well-being, o Aditi, make for us. 15. With well-being we would follow along our path, like the Sun and the Moon. May we meet up with one who gives in return, who does not smite, with one who knows.


14. May we cross over beyond scorners through your blessings, having left behind imperfection and hostilities. When it rains, the waters are luck and lifetime; at dawn they are medicine. May we be together with (them/you), o Maruts.

The hymn several times refers to the māyā́, the “cunning” of Mitra and Varuṇa (vss. 3, 4, 6, 7), which in its first and last attestations is described as the “cunning of a lord ( a﻿́sura)” (vss. 3, 7),


4. And you travel, Savitar, through the three luminous realms, and you are at home with the rays of the sun. And you encircle the night on both sides, and you become Mitra [/an ally], o god, through your supports.

For many are the goods in you, o Agni of many favors, for the one who does (you) honor, since you are king.

## Surviving Your Stupid, Stupid Decision to Go to Grad School, Adam Ruben


Every seminar is different, in the same way that the circles of Hell are different. But they share some of the same unfortunate qualities, too. After you’ve stolen the requisite bagel, watch for the following to happen in your next departmental seminar: The speaker will read a wordy slide verbatim, thus defeating the purpose of a talk. Something won’t transfer from Mac to PC. The faculty member who once glared at you for falling asleep will fall asleep. A poor, misguided student will actually take notes. The projector will malfunction, and a room full of PhD’s will be unable to fix it. The speaker will explain abbreviations and acronyms more quickly than can be realistically remembered, leading no one in the room to marvel when he concludes, “And it turned out the answer was a combination of DMSO and PLM4!” A slide will include unnecessary animation, and results will spiral or bounce into place while the speaker grins and everyone under thirty rolls their eyes. You will become painfully aware that it’s a beautiful day outside. You will doodle. It will be pretty. You will start writing a list of things you need to accomplish as soon as they let you out of this freaking room. The speaker will spend ten minutes thanking people no one in the room has heard of. If the speaker has a laser pointer, he will laser-point to items to which lasers needn’t point. The speaker will make statements clearly designed to demonstrate that he is smarter than you. He will alternate this practice with long, laborious explanations of something all attendees know already. Spittle will be visible. The student who asks every speaker a question … will ask the speaker a question. The slideshow will advance too far by accident, and the speaker will need help finding the “back” button. If the speaker uses actual transparencies or gives an old-school “chalk talk,” he will act all superior about it. The final slide will include a cute cartoon. Too little, too late. Fifteen minutes past the scheduled end time, there will be no end in sight. Is nothing sacred?

## The Enchiridion, - Epictetus


Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions. 


whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you. 


But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession. 


When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. 


Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well. 


Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing." When you call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power to give you any disturbance. 


You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own control to conquer. 


anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. 


For how can he who does not frequent the door of any [great] man, does not attend him, does not praise him, have an equal share with him who does? You are unjust, then, and insatiable, if you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for nothing. For how much is lettuce sold? Fifty cents, for instance. If another, then, paying fifty cents, takes the lettuce, and you, not paying it, go without them, don't imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuce, so you have the fifty cents which you did not give. 


you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. 


For you have never entered upon anything considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination. 


first acquire a distinct knowledge that every event is indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may be, for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder; 


When walking, you are careful not to step on a nail or turn your foot; so likewise be careful not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And, if we were to guard against this in every action, we should undertake the action with the greater safety. 


as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds a due measure, there is no bound. 


42. When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. 


44. These reasonings are unconnected: "I am richer than you, therefore I am better"; "I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better." The connection is rather this: "I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;" "I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours." But you, after all, are neither property nor style. 


For sheep don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. 


when you are violently thirsty, take a little cold water in your mouth, and spurt it out and tell nobody. 


This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off.

A man travelling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger after him. Coming to a precipice, he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Trembling, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him. Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started to gnaw away the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted!

After having thus indicated very briefly the general idea  or rather the ultimate scope  of our investigation, let me describe the line of attack.


Suppose that you could mark the molecules in a glass of water; then pour the contents of the glass into the ocean and stir the latter thoroughly so as to distribute the marked molecules uniformly throughout the seven seas; if then you took a glass of water anywhere out of the ocean, you would find in it about a hundred of your marked molecules.


Why must our bodies be so large compared with the atom?


We cannot see or feel or hear the single atoms.


If it were not so, if we were organisms so sensitive that a single atom, or even a few atoms, could make a perceptible impression on our senses  Heavens, what would life be like!


Nevertheless, the one and only thing of paramount interest to us in ourselves is, that we feel and think and perceive. To the physiological process which is responsible for thought and sense all the others play an auxiliary part, at least from the human point of view, if not from that of purely objective biology.


Why should an organ like our brain, with the sensorial system attached to it, of necessity consist of an enormous number of atoms, in order that its physically changing state should be in close and intimate correspondence with a highly developed thought?


Because we know all atoms to perform all the time a completely disorderly heat motion, which, so to speak, opposes itself to their orderly behaviour and does not allow the events that happen between a small number of atoms to enrol themselves according to any recognizable laws. Only in the co-operation of an enormously large number of atoms do statistical laws begin to operate and control the behaviour of these assemblées with an accuracy increasing as the number of atoms involved increases.


If you fill an oblong quartz tube with oxygen gas and put it into a magnetic field, you find that the gas is magnetized. The magnetization is due to the fact that the oxygen molecules are little magnets and tend to orientate themselves parallel to the field, like a compass needle. But you must not think that they actually all turn parallel. For if you double the field, you get double the magnetization in your oxygen body, and that proportionality goes on to extremely high field strengths, the magnetization increasing at the rate of the field you apply.


You have to multiply observations, in order to eliminate the effect of the Brownian movement of your instrument. This example is, I think, particularly illuminating in our present investigation. For our organs of sense, after all, are a kind of instrument. We can see how useless they would be if they became too sensitive.


The laws of physics and physical chemistry are inaccurate within a probable relative error of the order of 1/√n, where n is the number of molecules that co-operate to bring about that law  to produce its validity within such regions of space or time (or both) that matter, for some considerations or for some particular experiment.


As we shall presently see, incredibly small groups of atoms, much too small to display exact statistical laws, do play a dominating role in the very orderly and lawful events within a living organism. They have control of the observable large-scale features which the organism acquires in the course of its development, they determine

## The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali, Edwin F. Bryant


Sāṅkhya occupies itself with the path of reasoning to attain liberation, specifically concerning the analysis of the manifold ingredients of prakṛti from which the puruṣa is to be extricated, and Yoga more with the path of meditation, focusing on the nature of mind and consciousness, and on the techniques of concentration in order to provide a practical method through which the puruṣa can be isolated and extricated.


The succinctness of the Yoga Sūtras—it contains about 1,200 words in 195 sūtras—indicates that they were construed to be a manual requiring unpacking. That the sūtras, or aphorisms, are in places cryptic, esoteric, and incomprehensible in their own terms points to the fact that they were intended to be used in conjunction with a teacher:


It is Vyāsa who determined what Patañjali’s abstruse sūtras meant, and all subsequent commentators elaborated on Vyāsa.


in Sāṅkhya and Yoga, thought, feeling, emotion, memory, etc., are as material or physical as the visible ingredients of the empirical world.1


In the Sāṅkhya (literally, numeration) system, the universe of animate and inanimate entities is perceived as ultimately the product of two ontologically distinct categories; hence this system is quintessentially dvaita, or dualistic in presupposition.


These two categories are prakṛti, or the primordial material matrix of the physical universe, “the undifferentiated plenitude of being,”13 and puruṣa, the innumerable conscious souls or selves embedded within it. As a result of the interaction between these two entities, the material universe evolves in stages. The actual catalysts in this evolutionary process are the three guṇas, literally, strands or qualities, that are inherent in prakṛti. These are sattva, lucidity; rajas, action; and tamas, inertia.


sattva (from the root as, “to be”15)


sattva (from the root as, “to be”15) is predominant in an individual, the qualities of lucidity, tranquillity, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, happiness, and peacefulness manifest; when rajas (from the root rañj, to color, to redden) is predominant, hankering, attachment, energetic endeavor, passion, power, restlessness, and creative activity manifest; and when tamas, the guṇa least favorable for yoga, is predominant, stillness, ignorance, delusion, disinterest, lethargy, sleep, and disinclination toward constructive activity manifest.


lucidity, tranquillity, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, happiness, and peacefulness manifest; when


air contains more of the buoyancy of sattva; stones, more of the sluggishness of the tamas element; and fire, more rajas (although its buoyancy betrays its partial nature of sattva as well).


according to classical Sāṅkhya,18 the first evolute emerging from prakṛti when it is churned by the guṇas (sattva specifically) is buddhi, intelligence. Intelligence is characterized by the functions of judgment, discrimination, knowledge, ascertainment, will, virtue, and detachment,19 and sattva is predominant in it.


From buddhi, ahaṅkāra, or ego, is produced (aham, I + kāra, doing; referred to as asmitā in this text). This is characterized by the function of self-awareness and

In other words, the ahaṅkāra of a bug acts almost like a concave screen that refracts consciousness to pervade and appropriate the contours of the bug. If the bug dies and becomes, say, a dog and then a human in subsequent lives, the ahaṅkāra aspect of the citta adjusts to accommodate and absorb consciousness into these new environments. Thus the bug thinks it is a bug, the dog thinks it is a dog, and the human thinks he or she is a human.


Buddhi, intelligence; ahaṅkāra, ego; and manas, mind, together comprise the internal body (antaḥkaraṇa), the inner noetic world of thoughts, emotions, feelings, determination, will, cognitions, memories, etc.


from the ego stirred by tamas emerge the tanmātras, or subtle elements—the energies or powers underpinning sound, sight, smell, taste, and touch. These are the generic energies behind the sensory powers, not specific sounds or varieties of tastes, etc., hence their name, tanmātra, only that (namely, the essences of these energies, not their particular individualized expressions).22 Since knowledge and illumination are qualities of sattva, the tanmātras are still very sāttvic in nature. These, in turn, sequentially produce the five mahābhūtas, or gross elements—ether, air, fire, water, and earth—the world of form, the actual physical, tangible stuff of the universe.


the effects of the world are present in their cause.


Gross matter is actually an evolute or derivative of something subtler, the subtle elements, and these of something subtler still, the ego, which is an evolute of buddhi, intelligence. This means buddhi underpins all reality, even as buddhi itself is a manifestation of prakṛti and the guṇas, or, put differently, any expression of reality, subjective or objective, is nothing other than a manifestation of the guṇas. These evolutes are all called tattvas, thatnesses; they are the real constituents of “that” world out there perceived by the self.


The citta can profitably be compared to the software, and the body to the hardware. Neither is conscious; they are rather forms of gross matter, even as the former can do very intelligent activities. Both software and hardware are useless without the presence of a conscious observer. Only puruṣa is truly alive, that is, aware or conscious.


(Ignorance is mysterious, since the question of how it comes to arise in the first place is bypassed by all Indic metaphysicians by stating that it is beginningless.


Vācaspati Miśra traces the etymology of yoga to one of the meanings of the root yuj, to contemplate,


The more established etymology from the perspective of modern historical linguistics is, of course, derived from the same Indo-European root as the English word “yoke.”9 Yoga can thus mean that which joins, that is, unites one with the Absolute Truth, and while this translation of the term is popularly found (and may be apt in other contexts, such as the Gītā, IX.3410), it is best avoided in the context of the Yoga Sūtras, since, as was pointed out over a hundred years ago by the famous Indologist Max Müller (1899, 309ff) (and long before that, by the sixteenth-century Indian doxographer Mādhava11) the goal of yoga is not to join, but the opposite: to unjoin, that is, to disconnect puruṣa from prakṛti.12 If the term is to mean “yoke,” it entails yoking the mind on an object of concentration without deviation.


when the mind is directed toward an object, it can manifest five different degrees of focus (bhūmis): wondering, confused, distracted, concentrated, and restrained. It is the last two that are of interest to Yoga: when the mind, citta, is restrained and concentrated, or fixed on one point,

persona.22 At death, the soul discards the gross body (which returns to the material elements, to “dust”) but remains encapsulated in the subtle body, which is retained from life to life, and eventually attains a new gross body, in accordance with natural laws (karma, etc.).


Just as a person with a torch in hand gives up the torch upon finding treasure, says Vijñānabhikṣu, so, eventually, the intellect, and the knowledge that it presents, also become redundant upon attaining the ultimate source of truth, puruṣa, the soul and innermost self.


In


In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad, for example, “yoga is believed to be when the senses are firmly under control” (VI.11), while in the karma-yoga (path of action) section of the Bhagavad Gītā, yoga is defined as samatvam, evenness of mind (II.48) and as karmasu kauśalam, skill in action (II.50). Elsewhere, the text defines yoga as duḥkha-saṁyoga-viyogam, separation from union with pain (VI.23),


According to Patañjali’s definition in this sūtra, yoga is the cessation (nirodha) of the permutations or activities (vṛttis) of the citta.


in Sāṅkhya, ultimate reality is perceived as the product of two distinct ontological categories: prakṛti, or the primordial material matrix of the physical universe, and puruṣa, pure awareness, the innermost conscious self or soul (the terms “consciousness” and “awareness,” although problematic,28 will be used interchangeably in this commentary to refer to the nature of the puruṣa). As a result of the contact between these two distinct entities, prakṛti and puruṣa, the material universe evolves in a sequential fashion.


it is buddhi that molds itself into the forms of the data funneled to it by manas, below, and presents these images to the puruṣa soul, to which it is immediately adjacent.


Ahaṅkāra, or ego,32 produces the function of thought related to self-awareness, self-identity, and self-conceit


personal pronoun aham means I, and kāra, the doer).


It also delimits awareness, which is potentially omnipresent,33 and refracts it to fit into the contours of the particular body and mind within which it finds itself.


Manas, the mind, is the aspect of citta that engages in the functions of thought especially related to organizing sensory input and directing the senses;


As the village chief collects rent from the heads of the families and presents it to the district chief, who delivers it to the chief superintendent, who delivers it to the king, so the sense organs, having perceived an external object, deliver it to the mind, who considers it and delivers it to the ego, who appropriates it and delivers it to the intelligence, the chief superintendent of all. Thus it is said “they present it to intelligence, [thereby] illuminating the purpose of the puruṣa.“


vṛt means to revolve, turn, proceed, move,


The sense objects provide images that are received through the senses, sorted by the manas, the thinking and organizing aspect of citta, and presented to the intellect. Although inanimate, the intellect molds itself into the form and shape of these objects of experience, thoughts, and ideas. Vijñānabhikṣu compares this process to liquid copper being poured into a mold and taking the exact shape of the mold, although the forms into which buddhi is molded are extremely subtle and psychic in nature.


The Mahābhārata states that as one can light thousands of lamps from one lamp, so prakṛti can produce hundreds of thousands of transformations of the guṇas (XII, 301, 15–16).


guṇas.43 Kṛṣṇa makes the useful observation that the guṇas are in continual tension with each other, one guṇa becoming prominent in an individual for a while and suppressing the others, only to be dominated in turn by the emergence of one of the other guṇas (Bhagavad Gītā XIV.10).


sattva is the guṇa most conducive—indeed, indispensable—to the yogic enterprise, but while rajas and tamas are universally depicted as obstacles to yoga, a certain amount of each guṇa is indispensable to embodied existence. Without tamas, for example, there would be no sleep; without rajas, no digestion or even the energy to blink an eye.


The etymological meaning of sattva is the nature of being.


it is sattva that can reveal matter for what it is before rajas and tamas cause it to transform.


When lead is burned with gold, says Bhoja Rāja, it not only burns away the impurities in gold, but burns itself away too;


For Buddhists, when the objects of consciousness are removed, so is consciousness. There is thus no ultimate, eternal, essential entity such as a puruṣa, soul, that is separable from an object of consciousness; indeed, clinging to such notions of an autonomous self is the very cause of saṁsāra.


“As a dancer ceases from the dance after having been seen by the audience, so also prakṛti ceases after having manifested herself to the puruṣa”


As the Buddha is reputed to have said, if a man is shot by an arrow, it is useless to inquire as to the nature of the arrow, its point of origin, etc.


One should more profitably first remove the arrow.58


One should more profitably first remove the arrow.58 Likewise, for one drowning in the ocean of birth and death, saṁsāra, it is fruitless to speculate as to how one originally fell in; it would be more productive to find first a means to get out. Such a means, of course, is yoga.


karma refers not only to an initial act, whether benevolent or malicious, but also to the reaction it produces


This cycle of action and reaction, or saṁsāra, is potentially eternal and unlimited since not only does any one single act breed a reaction, but the actor must then react to this reaction, causing a rereaction, which in term fructifies and provokes rerereactions, and so on ad infinitum.


other words, for the novice struggling to control his or her mind, even if the emergence of sattva occurs only periodically, it is always a beneficial occurence, and it can be gradually increased and strengthened by a yogic lifestyle. The reverse also holds true, adds Vyāsa: Detrimental vṛttis also can surface periodically in a predominantly sāttvic citta (hence the Gītā’s statement in II.60 that the senses can carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination).


For example, a particular type of experience, say smoking a cigarette, is imprinted in the citta as a saṁskāra, which then activates as a desirable memory or impulse, provoking a repetition of this activity, which is likewise recorded, and so on until a cluster or grove of saṁskāras of an identical or similar sort is produced in the citta, gaining strength with each repetition. The stronger or more dominant such a cluster of saṁskāras becomes, the more it activates and imposes itself upon the consciousness of the individual, demanding indulgence and perpetuating a vicious cycle that can be very hard to break. The reverse, of course, also holds true with benevolent akliṣṭa-vṛttis: One can become addicted, so to speak, to benevolent yogic activities and lifestyle by constant repetition. Kleśas, vṛttis, saṁskāras, and karma are thus all interconnected links in the chain of saṁsāra.


9.   Interestingly, all the Upaniṣads wherein Yoga is expressed belong to the same Vedic branch, that of the black Yajur Veda.


the tanmātras can be considered the universals, sāmānya, of sound, taste, etc., rather than individuators, viśeṣa, of particular notes of the scale, range of tastes, etc.


enumerate six schools of thought that emerged from the Upaniṣadic period of the late Vedic age (although, as noted in the introduction, the first textual reference to such six schools can be attested only very late). Among these, the Mīmāṁsā school, noteworthy for its treatment of epistemology, formulated a rationale for perpetuating the old Vedic sacrificial rites. The Nyāya school was best known for developing rules of logic so that the debates between the various schools could be conducted according to conventions about what constituted valid argument. The Vaiśeṣika school provided a metaphysics that perceived the created world as ultimately consisting of the combination of various eternal categories such as subatomic particles. The Sāṅkhya school posited a contrasting metaphysical system in which the created world evolved out of primordial matter, prakṛti, from which the puruṣa, soul, must extricate itself. The Vedānta school was concerned less with the physical constituents of the material world and more with the relationship among Brahman, the Supreme Truth of the Upaniṣads; ātman, the individualized feature of Brahman; and the perceived world as an emanation of Brahman. Finally, the Yoga school as represented by Patañjali is less a philosophical school than a practical psychosomatic technique through which the puruṣa—the ātman of the Upaniṣads—can be realized as distinct from prakṛti. As noted in the introduction, Yoga referred to a cluster of meditative techniques, some form of which was common to numerous different schools and sects, rather than a distinct philosophical school.


Brahmā, the secondary creator god of Hinduism, is said to have uttered atha along with oṁ in the beginning of creation


in certain Vedānta traditions where the ātman might be conceived as uniting with Brahman, in the Yoga tradition, ātman (puruṣa) does not come into contact with anything other than itself, and hence union is problematic, unless used very loosely. Second, yoga is more accurately a process of disunion, that is, of puruṣa breaking its union with prakṛti rather than uniting with anything.


mind is overcome primarily by tamas, it becomes inclined to vice, ignorance, attachment, and impotence, and when it is overcome primarily by rajas, it becomes inclined to the opposite types of qualities.


This is perhaps the most essential metaphysical difference between Hindu (and Jain) traditions and Buddhist ones.

## Indian Summer, Alex von Tunzelmann


fourteen-year-old great-grandson of Queen Victoria, His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg. Prince Louis was born on 24 June 1900, at which point forty-eight people would have had to die, abdicate, or marry Catholics in order for him to become King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Emperor of India. He was always known within the family as ‘Dickie’.


fight.32 Even among Indians there was support for Dyer. The Sikh leaders in Amritsar made him an honorary Sikh, staging a special ceremony in their holiest site, the Golden Temple.33


To be free, Indians needed to relinquish violence, material possessions, machinery, railways, lawyers, doctors, formal education, the English language, discord between Hindu and Muslim, alcohol, and sex.


Nehru saw social and economic hardship as a cause of suffering, and therefore wanted to end it; Gandhi saw hardship as noble and righteous, and therefore wanted to spread the blessings of poverty and humility to all people.


was not that he considered caste unimportant. The Nehru family had been demonstrably opposed to Untouchability for longer than Gandhi – Motilal Nehru had appalled his more devout friends by employing an Untouchable to work as his valet and, even more shockingly, another as his cook.


Whatever happened to Bose, the INA was finished as a political or military force. Despite his disgust at Bose’s totalitarian leanings, Nehru was moved by the passion of his soldiers. The trial of INA officers at the Red Fort in December 1945 would persuade him to swallow his long-held principle that, because he did not recognize the British regime, he could not participate in its legal system. He donned the wig and gown of a British barrister for the last time in his life to defend them.


‘We will have,’ Jinnah announced, ‘either a divided India or a destroyed India.’33


Women were prominent in Indian politics, a trend which Edwina Mountbatten, along with many Indian women, attributed to Gandhism. Non-violence, passive resistance and boycotts were all tactics which could be practised by women without breaking social conventions; and Nehru had insisted as early as 1937 that the Congress manifesto pledge to remove all social, economic and political discrimination against women. As a result, there were more powerful women in India’s Congress than there were in Britain’s Labour Party or in America’s Democratic Party at the time.


As Edwina would later tell an audience in London, ‘We shall have to wake up in this country when we see how the women of India have achieved emancipation to such a remarkable degree in spite of the backwardness of the country, the illiteracy of the people, the low standard of life, and all kinds of disadvantages from the point of view of religious feeling and other obstacles.’32


On 9 July, representatives of the states met in New Delhi to ascertain their starting positions. The great majority inclined to join India. But four of the most important states – Hyderabad, Kashmir, Bhopal and Travancore – wanted to become independent nations. Each of these states had its own unique set of difficulties. The Nizam of Hyderabad was the richest man in the world; he was a Muslim, and his people were mostly Hindus. His state was enormous, and both France and the United States were rumoured to be ready to recognize it.35 The Maharaja of Kashmir was a Hindu; his people were mostly Muslims. His state was even bigger than Hyderabad, but more limited by its lack of trade routes and industrial potential. The Nawab of Bhopal was an able and ambitious Muslim prince, and one of Jinnah’s advisers: unfortunately for him, his state had a Hindu majority, and was stuck right in the middle of India, over 500 miles from the likely border with Pakistan. Uranium deposits had recently been discovered in Travancore, lending the situation there a greater international interest.


Nawab of Bhopal attempted to get the states to band together, so that they might hold out for independence: such a coalition might have formed an area the size of Pakistan. Not only Lord Mountbatten, but also Lady Mountbatten, crushed the plan, according to the Maharawal of Dungarpur: ‘It was an end brought about by one man and his wife.’38


The Nizam cabled Churchill in June asking him to demonstrate his sympathy and support for the Indian princely order, a cause which he had championed in the past. Churchill replied with what can only be described as a snub, merely thanking him for his kind message.


The high point came when the Dewan of Kutch, representing the ailing Maharao of Kutch who had gone to Britain for medical treatment, questioned Mountbatten. The Dewan protested that he did not know his Maharao’s mind, and could not raise him from his sickbed with a telegram. Mountbatten picked up a glass paperweight that happened to be on his rostrum. ‘I will look into my crystal,’ he said, ‘and give you an answer.’ A full ten seconds of astonished silence ensued as Mountbatten peered into the paperweight. Finally, with faultless comic timing, the Viceroy intoned: ‘His Highness asks you to sign the Instrument of Accession.’59


office.67 Whatever may be said about Mountbatten’s tactics or the machinations of Patel, their achievement remains remarkable. Between them, and in less than a year, it may be argued that these two men achieved a larger India, more closely integrated, than had 90 years of the British raj, 180 years of the Mughal Empire, or 130 years of Asoka and the Maurya rulers.


In 1556, aged fourteen, Akbar had been crowned emperor at Gurdaspur.

## Strictly English: The correct way to write ... and why it matters, Simon Heffer


The dictionary defines viable as “capable of living”, and therefore a term that should correctly be applied to beings, organisms and plants capable of life. However, it also cites a number of uses of the word since the 1950s in which it is used figuratively “of immaterial things and concepts”


We often read in newspapers that somebody has warned that something will happen. This is ungrammatical. The verb warn is transitive: it requires an object. Somebody has to be warned. If no such person or people is or are available (which is unlikely to be the case) then one has to write that somebody gave warning that such and such a thing would happen.


What is happening to the verb warn is a sign of the constant evolution of our language.


confusion is avoided when the pronoun is not too far removed from the noun or proper name to which it relates:


A sentence such as “he resented the fact that he had no power to refuse the summons, as his colleagues had”, is wrong. It is also ambiguous: do his colleagues have the power to refuse, or have they already refused? If the second clause began “such as his colleagues had” it would be correct: the such can refer only to power.


Elsewhere I lament and advise against the overuse of adjectives: they are a habit many writers need to bring under control.


The two main categories of verb are the transitive and the intransitive. A transitive verb is one where a subject does something to a direct object – “the dog ate the bone” or “the woman threw the ball”. An intransitive verb has no direct object: “he slept soundly” or “he dreamt he was there”.

## At the Existentialist Café, Sarah Bakewell


Sartre believed. But as a human being, I have no predefined nature at all. I create that nature through what I choose to do. Of course I may be influenced by my biology, or by aspects of my culture and personal background, but none of this adds up to a complete blueprint for producing me. I am always one step ahead of myself, making myself up as I go along.


Sartre believed. But as a human being, I have no predefined nature at all. I create that nature through what I choose to do. Of course I may be influenced by my biology, or by aspects of my culture and personal background, but none of this adds up to a complete blueprint for producing me. I am always one step ahead of myself, making myself up as I go along. Sartre put this principle into a three-word slogan, which for him defined existentialism: ‘Existence precedes essence’.


You should make your choices as though you were choosing on behalf of the whole of humanity, taking the entire burden of responsibility for how the human race behaves. If you avoid this responsibility by fooling yourself that you are the victim of circumstance or of someone else’s bad advice, you are failing to meet the demands of human life and choosing a fake existence, cut off from your own ‘authenticity’.


Sartre summed it up in an interview shortly after the lecture: There is no traced-out path to lead man to his salvation; he must constantly invent his own path. But, to invent it, he is free, responsible, without excuse, and every hope lies within him.


When Sartre was offered the Légion d’honneur for his Resistance activities in 1945, and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, he rejected them both, citing a writer’s need to stay independent of interests and influences.

concentration and effort must constantly be renewed. To practise it, he wrote, ‘a new way of looking at things is necessary’ — a way that brings us back again and again to our project, so as ‘to see what stands before our eyes, to distinguish, to describe’. This was Husserl’s natural style of working. It was also a perfect definition of phenomenology.

One might never finish adequately describing a cup of coffee. Yet it is a liberating task: it gives us back the world we live in. It works most effectively on the things we may not usually think of as material for philosophy: a drink, a melancholy song, a drive, a sunset, an ill-at-ease mood, a box of photographs, a moment of boredom. It restores this personal world in its richness, arranged around our own perspective yet usually no more noticed than the air.

As Arendt might put it, we slip into banality, failing to think.


Jaspers focused on what he called Grenzsituationen — border situations, or limit situations. These are the moments when one finds oneself constrained or boxed in by what is happening, but at the same time pushed by these events towards the limits or outer edge of normal experience.

In his essay ‘On the Ontological Mystery’, written in 1932 and published in the fateful year of 1933, Marcel wrote of the human tendency to become stuck in habits, received ideas, and a narrow-minded attachment to possessions and familiar scenes. Instead, he urged his readers to develop a capacity for remaining ‘available’ to situations as they arise.

Most people fall into what he calls ‘crispation’: a tensed, encrusted shape in life — ‘as though each one of us secreted a kind of shell which gradually hardened and imprisoned him’. Marcel’s ‘shell’ recalls Husserl’s notion of the accumulated and inflexible preconceptions that one should set aside in the epoché, so as to open up access to the ‘things themselves’.


The manifold uncanny holds sway And nothing uncannier than man.


There is a part of everything that remains unexplored, for we have fallen into the habit of remembering, whenever we use our eyes, what people before us have thought of the thing we are looking at. Even the slightest thing contains a little that is unknown. We must find it. To describe a blazing fire or a tree in a plain, we must remain before that fire or that tree until they no longer resemble for us any other tree or any other fire.

Even our bodies rarely require conscious attention, yet a sense of being embodied is part of almost every experience we have.


Even our bodies rarely require conscious attention, yet a sense of being embodied is part of almost every experience we have. As I move around or reach out to grasp something, I sense my own limbs and the arrangement of my physical self in the world. I feel my hands and feet from within; I don’t have to look in a mirror to see how they are positioned. This is known as ‘proprioception’ — the perception of self — and it is an important aspect of experience which I tend to notice only when something goes wrong with it. When I encounter others, says Husserl, I also recognise them implicitly as beings who have ‘their personal surrounding world, oriented around their living bodies’. Body, life-world, proprioception and social context are all integrated into the texture of worldly being.

a reminder of the role contingency plays in even the most well-managed human affairs.


‘I have never had a great love or a great friendship; but that is because I never met a man or a woman who were worthy of it; if I have not written any very good books, it is because I had not the leisure to do so.’ We do say such things, all the time; but we are in bad faith when we do it.


Heidegger uses military images: ‘Everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately at hand, indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further ordering.’


Enabling things to un-hide themselves is what humans do: it is our distinctive contribution.


Her last work, The Need for Roots, argues, among other things, that none of us has rights, but each one of us has a near-infinite degree of duty and obligation to the other.


Soviet forces swooped and cut off all supplies coming into the western side of Berlin. In March 1948 they blocked the railway lines, and in June they cut off the roads. They set out to starve Berlin into submission, just as the Germans had starved Leningrad during the war. To this, the Western powers responded with a bold remedy. They simply flew in everything that the city needed: food, coal, medicines. For over a year, absolutely everything necessary for survival came in by air, in an operation known as the Berlin Airlift. At one stage, a plane was landing in Berlin at a rate of one every minute, twenty-four hours a day. In May 1949, a deal was finally struck with the Soviets and the blockade was eased, but the planes kept flying in from the West until the end of that September. Berlin had no wall yet; that went up in 1961.


pariah — thus, a free choice


existentialism is always a philosophy of freedom in situation.


The Phenomenology of Perception: I am a psychological and historical structure. Along with existence, I received a way of existing, or a style. All of my actions and thoughts are related to this structure, and even a philosopher’s thought is merely a way of making explicit his hold upon the world, which is all he is. And yet, I am free, not in spite of or beneath these motivations, but rather by their means. For that meaningful life, that particular signification of nature and history that I am, does not restrict my access to the world; it is rather my means of communication with it.


Merleau-Ponty instead saw quite calmly that we exist only through compromise with the world — and that this is fine. The point is not to fight that fact, or to inflate it into too great a significance, but to observe and understand exactly how that compromise works.


Of course we have to learn this skill of interpreting and anticipating the world, and this happens in early childhood, which is why Merleau-Ponty thought child psychology was essential to philosophy.


Childhood looms large in Beauvoir’s The Second Sex and in Sartre’s biographies; Sartre wrote in his Flaubert book that ‘all of us are constantly discussing the child we were, and are’. But his strictly philosophical treatises do not prioritise childhood as Merleau-Ponty’s do.


The interwoven figure calls to mind two hands grasping each other, or the way a woollen thread loops back to grip itself in a knitting stitch. As Merleau-Ponty put it: ‘the hold is held’.


for him, looking and being looked at are what weave us into the world and give us our full humanity.


for him, looking and being looked at are what weave us into the world and give us our full humanity. Sartre acknowledged this interweaving, and he also acknowledged the importance of the body, but it all seemed to make him nervous. Some kind of struggle is always going on in Sartre’s work — against facticity, against being devoured by the quicksand of Being, and against the power of the Other. Merleau-Ponty doesn’t struggle much, and doesn’t seem to fear dissolving into the syrupy or vaporous. In The Visible and the Invisible, he gives us some very un-Sartrean descriptions of erotic encounters, describing how one body embraces another along its length, ‘forming tirelessly with its hands the strange statue which in its turn gives everything it receives; the body is lost outside of the world and its goals, fascinated by the unique occupation of floating in Being with another life.’ Sartre once remarked — speaking of a disagreement they had about Husserl in 1941 — that ‘we discovered, astounded, that our conflicts had, at times,


‘The philosopher is marked by the distinguishing trait that he possesses inseparably the taste for evidence and the feeling for ambiguity.’


We can never move definitively from ignorance to certainty, for the thread of the inquiry will constantly lead us back to ignorance again.


Sartre replied that there was a mathematical difference, of course, but not a philosophical one, for each individual is an infinite universe in his or her own eyes, and one cannot compare one infinity with another.

Kierkegaard had said: It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards. And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting-place from which to understand it.


If a lot of people with incompatible interests all claim that right is on their side, how do you decide between them? In a paragraph of the final part of The Communists and Peace, Sartre had sketched the outline of a bold solution: why not decide every situation by asking how it looks to ‘the eyes of the least favoured’, or to ‘those treated the most unjustly’?


Sartre agreed. Asked in 1975 to name his worst failing, he replied, ‘Naturally in the course of my life I have made lots of mistakes, large and small, for one reason or another. But at the heart of it all, every time I made a mistake it was because I was not radical enough.’


human need for meaning was almost as vital as that for food or sleep.

In the eighteenth century Marie Antoinette allegedly advised the starving masses that if they ran out of bread, they should just eat cake instead. Today, the poor are following this advice to the letter. Whereas the rich residents of Beverly Hills eat lettuce salad and steamed tofu with quinoa, in the slums and ghettos the poor gorge on Twinkie cakes, Cheetos, hamburgers and pizza. In 2014 more than 2.1 billion people were overweight, compared to 850 million who suffered from malnutrition. Half of humankind is expected to be overweight by 2030.4 In 2010 famine and malnutrition combined killed about 1 million people, whereas obesity killed 3 million.


In 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died due to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000). In contrast, 800,000 committed suicide, and 1.5 million died of diabetes.23 Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.


Anton Chekhov famously said that a gun appearing in the first act of a play will inevitably be fired in the third.


For the average American or European, Coca-Cola poses a far deadlier threat than al-Qaeda.


The fly is so weak that it cannot budge even a single teacup. So it finds a bull, gets inside its ear and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop.


Galileo Galilei died at seventy-seven, Isaac Newton at eighty-four, and Michelangelo lived to the ripe age of eighty-eight, without any help from antibiotics, vaccinations or organ transplants. Indeed, even chimpanzees in the jungle sometimes live into their sixties.29


It took just a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer?


If pupils suffer from attention disorders, stress and low grades, perhaps we ought to blame outdated teaching methods, overcrowded classrooms and an unnaturally fast tempo of life. Maybe we should modify the schools rather than the kids?


Yet hitherto everybody still agreed on one thing: in order to improve education, we need to change the schools. Today, for the first time in history, at least some people think it would be more efficient to change the pupils’ biochemistry.40


The state hopes to regulate the biochemical pursuit of happiness, separating ‘bad’ manipulations from ‘good’ ones. The principle is clear: biochemical manipulations that strengthen political stability, social order and economic growth are allowed and even encouraged (e.g. those that calm hyperactive kids in school, or drive anxious soldiers forward into battle).


Some 2,300 years ago Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy.


Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them, we don’t react to them with contentment; rather, we just crave for more.


To attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not accelerate it.


According to Buddha, we can train our minds to observe carefully how all sensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are – ephemeral and meaningless vibrations – we lose interest in pursuing them. For what is the point of running after something that disappears as fast as it arises?


Only once the last sword is beaten into a ploughshare should we turn our minds to the next big thing. But history doesn’t work like that. Those living in palaces have always had different agendas to those living in shacks, and that is unlikely to change in the twenty-first century.


Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance.


## Hit Makers, Derek Thompson


the architecture of the human mind is ancient, and the most basic human needs—to belong, to escape, to aspire, to understand, to be understood—are eternal.


The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises.


Content might be king, but distribution is the kingdom.


Television once freed “moving images” from the clutches of the cineplex; in the historical sequel, mobile technology is emancipating video from the living room.


Facebook, Twitter, and digital publishers have tools that tell them not only what story you click on, but also how far you read and where you click next.

Borges describes an empire with a cartography guild so advanced that it designs a life-size map. Yet the people reject this achievement of exactitude, and the map’s tatters ultimately serve to clothe beggars in the desert. There is virtue in simplicity. A paper map that is the exact size of the empire it describes is “Useless,” because a map is only of service if it is small enough for somebody to hold and read it. The world is complex. But all meaning comes from wise simplification.


At the end of the second course, Cutting asked the 151 students to choose their favorite paintings among fifty-one pairs. The results of the popularity contest turned the canon upside down. In forty-one of fifty-one pairs, the students’ preference for the most famous impressionist works disappeared. The emerald magnetism of Monet’s gardens, the electric polychrome of Renoir, and the genius of Manet were nearly nullified by something else—the power of repeated exposure.


Caillebotte is the least known of the French impressionists. But it’s not because he’s the worst. It’s because he offered his friends a gift that he was willing to withhold from himself: the gift of exposure.


Birkhoff went so far as to propose a formula for writing poetry: O = aa + 2r + 2m − 2ae − 2ce.2 (It is unlikely that any person has ever used the formula to write a poem worth reading.)


Losing oneself to wonder is the opposite of brainlessness. Pleasure is a kind of thinking.


The human face is slightly asymmetric, which means that a photograph captures a slightly different face than a mirror. People sometimes wince when they see photographs of themselves, and several studies show people prefer the face that they glimpse in a reflection.


People are born average and die unique.


There is some evidence that onlookers from various backgrounds and cultures are attracted to mountains divided by snaking rivers and forests cut by trails that slink away toward a vanishing point. These details signify something human ancestors would have loved to see: a navigable path through the chaos of nature.


beauty does not reside in forms, or cosmic ratios, or even in the standard-issue wiring of humans’ minds, hearts, and guts. It exists in the interplay between the world and people—which is to say, in life. People adapt. To paraphrase Tennyson, they are the sum of all they have met. They are born average and die unique.


Union Square nicknamed “Tin Pan Alley” developed an elaborate process of plugging new music. They would pass out song sheets to local musicians, who would play each tune in different neighborhoods, from the Lower East Side to the Upper West, and report back on which songs clicked.


Beyond a certain level of songwriting genius, how many times audiences have heard a melody matters more for its popularity than how inherently catchy it is.


When consumers don’t know the true value of the products they’re looking for, they rely on corporate iconography to guide them. But when they can figure out the absolute value of a product on their own, they ignore advertisements and brands. That’s why Simonson and Rosen have named their theory “absolute value.” The


The gatekeepers had their day. Now there are simply too many gates to keep.


Critique of Judgment, Immanuel Kant proposed that pleasure can arise from a “free play” of the mind. When a person discovers an attractive idea or story, it triggers a dialogue between imagination and understanding, each quickening the other.


Thus, familiarity, fluency, and fact are inextricably linked.


There is a play-it-at-home game to explain this effect. Follow these four steps: Think of the last movie, play, or TV show that you finished: Whisper it to yourself. Between 1 (awful) and 10 (perfect), imagine how you might rate it. Now think of seven specific things you liked about the movie or show. Count them on your fingers and don’t stop until you hit seven. Finalize your rating of the show. This sort of game is famous because something curious often happens: Between steps 2 and 4, the rating typically goes down. Why should one’s opinion of a show decline as you think of more reasons to like it? After a few easy examples come to mind, the effort to dig out more examples becomes

People experience disfluency. And sometimes, they misattribute the feeling of disfluency to the quality of the show itself. This is the “less is more” or “less is better” effect. It means that less thinking leads to more liking. A cheeky UK experiment found that British students’ opinion of former prime minister Tony Blair sank as they listed more of his good qualities. Spouses offer higher appraisals of their partners when asked to name fewer charming characteristics. When something becomes hard to think about, people transfer the discomfort of the thought to the object of their thinking. Almost every piece of media people consume, every purchase they make, every design they confront lives on a continuum between fluency and disfluency—ease of thinking and difficulty of thinking. Most people lead lives of quiet fluency. They listen to music that sounds like the music they’ve already heard. They look forward to movies with characters, actors, and plots that they recognize. They don’t heed political ideas from opposing parties, particularly if these ideas also seem painfully complicated. As we’ll see in the next chapter, this is a shame, because the greatest joys often come from discovering fluency in places you didn’t expect. Fluency’s attraction is obvious. But there is a quieter truth: People need a bit of its opposite. They want to be challenged, shocked, scandalized, forced to think—just a bit. They enjoy what Kant called free play—not just a monologue of fluency, but a dialogue between “I get it” and “I don’t” and “I want to know more.” People are complicated: curious and conservative, hungry for new things and biased toward the familiar. Familiarity is not the end. It’s just the beginning. This


because the greatest joys often come from discovering fluency in places you didn’t expect.


How do you make something new, if most people just like what they know? Is it possible to surprise with familiarity?


MAYA.


MAYA. People gravitate to products that are bold, yet instantly comprehensible—“Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”


Technology enabled choices and choices created fashion—that perpetual hype cycle where designs and colors and behaviors appear suddenly cool and then suddenly anachronistic.


Hekkert’s grand theory begins with two competing pressures. On the one hand, humans seek familiarity, because it makes them feel safe. On the other hand, people are charged by the thrill of a challenge, powered by a pioneer lust.


Loewy was an excellent teacher of consumer preferences in part because he was an obsessive student of consumer habits. He piggybacked off people’s behavior rather than design products that would force them to change their lives.


MAYA theory—Most Advanced Yet Acceptable—spoke


MAYA theory—Most Advanced Yet Acceptable—spoke to the tension between people’s interest in being surprised and feeling comforted. “The consumer is influenced in his choice of styling by two opposing factors: (a) attraction to the new and (b) resistance to the unfamiliar,” he wrote. “When resistance to the unfamiliar reaches the threshold of a shock-zone and resistance to buying sets in, the design in question has reached its MAYA stage: Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”


Loewy understood that attention doesn’t just pull in one direction. Instead, it is a tug-of-war between the opposing forces of neophilia versus neophobia,


one of the most powerful forces in popularity is the power of exposure. Exposure breeds familiarity, familiarity breeds fluency, and fluency often breeds liking. But there is such a thing as too much familiarity. It’s everywhere, in fact. It’s hearing a catchy song for the tenth time in a row, watching a movie that is oh so predictably uncreative, or hearing a talented speaker use overfamiliar buzzword after buzzword. In fluency studies, the power of familiarity is discounted when people realize that the moderator is trying to browbeat them with the same stimulus again and again. This is one reason why so much advertising doesn’t work: People have a built-in resistance to marketing that feels like it’s trying to seduce them.


Many people will put themselves through quite a bit of disfluent anguish if they expect fluent resolution at the end.


Max Planck, the theoretical physicist who helped lay the groundwork for quantum theory, said: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”


The most novel proposals got the worst ratings. “Everyone dislikes novelty,” lead author Karim Lakhani explained to me, and “experts tend to be overcritical of proposals in their own domain.” Extremely familiar proposals fared a little bit better, but they also received lower scores. The highest evaluation scores went to submissions that were deemed slightly new. There is an “optimal newness” for ideas, Lakhani said—advanced yet acceptable. The graph of optimal newness looks like this:


entrepreneur, the difference between a brilliant new idea with bad marketing and a mediocre idea with excellent marketing can be the difference between bankruptcy and success. The trick is learning to frame your new ideas as tweaks of old ideas, to mix a little fluency with a little disfluency—to make your audience see the familiarity behind the surprise.

ESPN had lost a sense of its core, Skipper told the company’s leaders at one of the first executive meetings. Rather than being great at serving one perfect product, like a steakhouse, it had become a network that served lots of mediocre fare, like a cheap diner.


These listeners want to be surprised—that’s why they play the radio rather than a CD or playlist—but they want to be surprised by the feeling of familiarity.


In an average week, ESPN delivers more than seven hundred million alerts to tens of millions of phones.


On Reddit, each piece of content is two parts: a headline and an article link. Users can promote links with “upvotes” or register their dissatisfaction with “downvotes.” Several years ago, a team of computer science researchers at Stanford University submitted and resubmitted thousands of images to Reddit with different headlines and controlled for network effects to see if the Reddit community had a clear preference for certain titles. They wanted to understand a question that I think about all the time: What makes a great headline?


Meanwhile, these Stanford computer scientists were putting empirical meat on the bare bones of my headline writing theories. They concluded that the most successful headlines on Reddit presented novel images or stories while “[conforming] to the linguistic norms of the community to which it is submitted.” A good headline, they said, is not overly familiar, but rather familiar enough; a welcome surprise expressed in the vernacular of its intended audience; a promise to advance understanding in a broadly acceptable subject—MAYA.


With more than eighty-one million listeners and twenty-one billion hours of played music each year, Pandora is the most popular digital radio app in the world. Name the bands you like, and Pandora builds a radio station around their sound. If I say I like the Beatles, Pandora will play the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, and newer bands with a Beatlesy vibe. Users can make the station better by signaling the songs they love or by skipping the songs they don’t.


“The dream of the alert industrial designer would be to design for teen-agers . . . Whether or not they fall periodically for some silly fad that does harm to no one, their basic taste remains fundamentally correct.”


Each week, Spotify bots hunt through several billion playlists from users around the world to see what songs are typically grouped together. Imagine that Song A, Song B, and Song C often appear together in the same playlist. If I often listen to Songs A and C, Spotify guesses that I’ll probably like Song B—even if I’ve never heard of its band. This way of predicting tastes by aggregating millions of people’s preferences is known as “collaborative filtering”—collaborative


“It turns out having a bit of familiarity bred trust, especially for first-time users. If we make a new playlist for you and there’s not a single thing for you to hook onto or recognize, to go, ‘Oh yeah, that’s a good call!’ it’s completely intimidating and people don’t engage.”


MAYA offers three clear lessons.


First: Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do.


Second: To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising, make it familiar.


The central insight of MAYA is that people actually prefer complexity—up to the point that they stop understanding something.


Third: People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love

Running up and down your arms, just beneath the surface of your skin, amid the veins, glands, arteries, vessels, and nerves, there is a smooth thin muscle gripping the bottom of each hair. It is called the arrector pili muscle, and it is activated by the sympathetic nervous system. This means you cannot control it, or flex it impressively on cue, like a bicep.

After most people are in their twenties or thirties, the soft clay of taste and ideology has hardened.


When people say “history” they tend to mean something that really happened, and when they say “story” they mean something made up. But the word “story” comes from the Latin historia. History is always a story, a narrative that provides both the benefits of fictional tales—temporal connectedness, a satisfying cause-and-effect plot, and drama with meaning—and their downsides.


There is a dark side to fluency—for both makers and consumers. When creative people are too familiar with their own projects, it hurts their ability to evaluate them.

Fashion is governed by a neophilic rule with a neophobic catch: New is good and old is bad (but very old is good again). There is a theoretical benchmark for how fashionable attitudes are shaped by the passage of time called Laver’s law, named after its originator, James Laver, a British fashion historian. It goes like this:


Distribution is a strategy to make a good product popular, but it’s not a reliable way to make a bad product seem good.


It was the ancient Greeks who finally introduced the concept of a vowel, which unlocked something previously impossible: The ability of anybody to pronounce any series of sounds by deciphering scribbles.


In 1635, the Royal Mail in Britain was made available to recipients who could pay the postage, marking Europe’s first public mail service. Two centuries later, a painter named Samuel Morse received a letter by mail that notified him of his wife’s tragic death. He immediately left Washington. But by the time he arrived in New Haven, she had already been buried. This reportedly inspired him to invent a faster mode of communication—the telegraph. Morse sent his first long-distance message in 1844, from Baltimore to Washington. Alexander Graham Bell placed the first phone call thirty-two years later.


Let’s pause here to acknowledge that, by 1900, humans had existed for two hundred thousand years and communication was still, in many ways, an ancient custom, just as first names were until the 1800s. People talked. Sometimes they sang. People read books, mostly religious texts. Some families wrote letters, and news might be transmitted by telegraph. But even the telephone seemed like a curious intrusion into the tradition of talking, and Americans appeared to have no idea what to do with it for years. It took less than ten years for cars, radios, color TVs, VCRs, cell phones, or the Internet to go from niche to mainstream—10 percent to 50 percent penetration—in the United States. It took the telephone almost forty years to make the same journey to the center of the mainstream.


If you think Tinder and dating apps are destroying romance today, you would have hated cars in the 1900s. Cars didn’t just hasten a historical shift from teenage codependence to independence.


It is precisely because they have so little to lose from the way things are that young people will continue to be the inexhaustibly neophilic motor of culture.

You can flip a coin until your fingers are numb, and the share of heads and tails will eventually approach fifty-fifty. But life is one giant roulette wheel that only spins around once for each person.


chaos of life is a chronic condition for which stories are the remedy.


“Rock Around the Clock” is a story of great songwriting, the broadcast power of film, and the crucible of 1950s teenage culture. But it is also a story of mind-boggling luck. Every person who listens to “Rock Around the Clock” hears the same notes, words, and syncopation. Audiences in 1954 heard a forgettable song. Audiences in 1955 heard the hit of the century. One song, two slightly different broadcasts, two extremely different outcomes. Sounds like a tune that a chaos theorist might sing.


Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist, is credited with discovering that income within a country follows a “power law,” such that 80 percent of wealth is held by 20 percent of the population. This Pareto principle has been extended to mean that 80 percent of sales often comes from 20 percent of products. In the movie sample De Vany studied, one fifth of the movies took four fifths of the box office. In book publishing, more like 90 percent of revenues come from about 10 percent of books. In digital markets, it’s even worse: 60 percent of all app store revenue comes from just 0.005 percent of companies. For hit makers, the vast majority of bets are failures. The difference between a great year and a terrible year in publishing might come down to a tiny minority of deals.


Live by the long ball, die by the long ball. Sooner or later, chaos wins.


So when you think about Haley, you should consider his surpassingly lucky break. But if you can hold it in your head next to Einstein, Pareto, and probabilities, think of this, too: a half-blind kid who taught himself guitar, followed his cowboy-western dreams through a thousand failed experiments just to get his turn inside a Masonic temple on April 12, 1954. And there, with just one shot to sing the melody that sold forty million records, he summoned his tired voice and counted up from “one.”


“Everything in the world is about sex, except sex,” Oscar Wilde said. “Sex is about power.”


Why do individuals like what they like? But the last few chapters have shown that this question alone is insufficient. People don’t make decisions individually. They aren’t just creatures of influence (“I bought it because it’s popular”). They’re also creatures of self-expression (“I bought it because it’s me”). People


One of the hallmarks of a cult is that members unite to oppose what they see as an oppressive or illegitimate mainstream culture. But if you recall from an earlier chapter, rejecting an illegitimate norm is precisely the sociological definition of being “cool.” So what’s the difference between what people consider “cultish” versus “cool”? Both groups self-organize around the idea that the world doesn’t get them. Both develop customs that belong to them exclusively. Perhaps a cult is an extreme version of homophily. But in a way, every social network is a soft cult—a place where people can, ironically, feel like individuals by belonging to a group.


First, people seek out others who are like them. Sociologists call this “sorting.”


First, people seek out others who are like them. Sociologists call this “sorting.” Second, individuals change to become more like the group around them. This is called “socializing.”


A 2012 Harvard study found that people use about one third of personal conversations to talk about themselves. Online, that number jumps to 80 percent. A person’s egoism quotient more than doubles when she opens a computer or lock screen. Look back at the Facebook article list: Nine of the ten stories have the words “you” or “your,” which, to each reader, mean “me” and “mine.”


The researchers provided each participant with details from an imaginary day, with several happy events (like joining a friend to see a great new movie) and some bummers (having an unappetizing dessert at a local bakery). They asked participants to document the day in a note, which was meant for one friend or a larger group. People were more forthright about the bad stuff in their lives when they thought they were addressing one person. When they thought they were addressing a larger group, they airbrushed their stories for dazzling happiness.

But it is an economic fact that predicting the future is most valuable when everybody thinks you’re wrong.


Imitating recent successes is a game that everybody knows how to play. But seeing the next big thing before anybody else sees it is far more valuable. It’s Buffett in 1990. It’s Murdoch in 2001. It’s Apple in 2007. It means being a little bit wrong at just the right time.


But perhaps another lesson is about the rewards of betting on talent over outcomes, or “people over products.”


When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

The distinction between surveys, a measure of the present, and polls, a measure of the future, points to the second lesson of Gallup’s Iowa Method. People are good at telling you their feelings.

decision-making model that he called OODA. The acronym stood for Observation, Orientation, Decision, and Action. It described a strategic approach in which information was constantly funneled back to the decision maker to construct a new theory of attack.


most successful warriors—or publishers, politicians, or sports coaches—aren’t necessarily the biggest and the strongest. Rather, a special few have the gift of perception and keen reactivity. They can size up an opponent, attack, absorb the meaning of the response, and gradually learn to anticipate the next move. On this point, Hamlet was brief, for once: “The readiness is all.”

ABC had made the park possible, but several years after it opened, the network sold its stake back to Disney. In retrospect, this was a horrifyingly bad idea, not unlike selling a band of rebels the weapons they’ll eventually use to sack your city. In 1995, the Walt Disney Company bought ABC for $19 billion, with many thanks to the profits from the very amusement park business that ABC had once financed.

Gallup’s method is best described as ethnography, and yet the field is often called “applied anthropology.” What’s the difference? Anthropology is the study of people and their environment. Ethnography is a method of studying people in their environment by observing them firsthand. Anthropology is a broad discipline, and ethnography is a specific method.


## The little green grammar book, Mark Tredinnick


What a sentence names is the subject; what the rest of the sentence tells you (about the subject) is its predicate.


sine qua non—the thing we cannot do without.


Every good sentence contains a subject and a predicate. And within that predicate is a verb that’s finite, a verb that’s fixed in time.


a sound sentence must be independent.


The is adjectival, or modifying: it helps signal which river.


What might otherwise be read as a sentence falls short of being so read if it begins with a word or small group of words like because, after, although, as a consequence, despite the fact that; or because the subject or object of the clause in question is a relative pronoun—which or that or who—none or which will bear the weight of an independent sentence.


The: • subject • verb • object • modifier.


Looking at a sentence this way—focusing on the four functions within it, rather than hunting down and labelling its many individual pieces—exposes the logic of the thing, the structure on which its meaning is strung, or from which it’s falling loose.


Picture this: a courier has a parcel for you; she pulls up at your place and puts it in your hands. If that scenario were a sentence, the courier would be its subject; giving would be its verb, since that is what goes on; the parcel would be its direct object, since it gets given; and you would be its indirect object, since you receive the object. you receive the object that receives the verb.


• Indicative: where the sentence declares a fact: He was an old man and he fished alone. • Imperative: where the sentence issues a command, makes a direction or invitation, or even offers an emphatic kind of wish: Stop right there; Go home; Click here; Drop by on your way through; Keep me briefed; Please tell me what to do; Get well soon; Sleep tight. • Subjunctive: where the sentence asks a reader to imagine an ideal or hypothetical—and sometimes impossible—scenario: If I were you …; He looks at her as though she were an angel;


It’s time to come down now. (Declarative) Do you think it’s time to come down now? (Closed interrogative) When do you think you’ll be ready to come down? (Open interrogative) Come down now.

## Meditations - Enhanced Edition (Illustrated. Newly revised text. Includes Image Gallery + Audio) (Stoics In Their Own Words Book 2), Marcus Aurelius and George Long


he could express approbation without noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.


Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess.


I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler.


Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.


The longest and shortest are thus brought to the same. For the present is the same to all, though that which perishes is not the same; and so that which is lost appears to be a mere moment.


Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of judgement. And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy.


We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.


Thou hast embarked, thou hast made the voyage, thou art come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there.


for even if he must depart immediately, he will go as readily as if he were going to do anything else which can be done with decency and order;


Nor is his life incomplete when fate overtakes him, as one may say of an actor who leaves the stage before ending and finishing the play.


let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely,


The universe is transformation: life is opinion.


The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also the names of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated, Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Leonnatus, and a little after also Scipio and Cato, then Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous way. For the rest, as soon as they have breathed out their breath, they are gone, and no man speaks of them.


Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.


When thou hast been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in a manner, quickly return to thyself and do not continue out of tune longer than the compulsion lasts; for thou wilt have more mastery over the harmony by continually recurring to it.


For it is in our power, as I said, to get out of the way, and to have no suspicion nor hatred. If any man


Take care that thou art not made into a Caesar, that thou art not dyed with this dye; for such things happen. Keep thyself then simple, good, pure, serious, free from affectation, a friend of justice, a worshipper of the gods, kind, affectionate, strenuous in all proper acts. Strive to continue to be such as philosophy wished to make thee. Reverence the gods, and help men. Short is life.


it? Is it not strange if the architect and the physician shall have more respect to the reason (the principles) of their own arts than man to his own reason, which is common to him and the gods?


He who has seen present things has seen all, both everything which has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for time without end; for all things are of one kin and of one form.


Nature which governs the whole will soon change all things which thou seest, and out of their substance will make other things, and again other things from the substance of them, in order that the world may be ever new.


Epicurus aid thee, that pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination: and remember this too, that we do not perceive that many things which are disagreeable to us are the same as pain, such as excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched by heat, and the having no appetite. When then thou art discontented about any of these things, say to thyself, that thou art yielding to pain.

Carrie came out rather testy, I thought. 


I suppose I am losing my sense of humour.


Master Lupin can make a fool of himself without any assistance.”


I told him it was a present from a dear friend, and one mustn’t look a gift-horse in the mouth.  Gowing facetiously replied: “And he didn’t like putting it in the mouth either.”


We are sorry to lose him, but perhaps he will get on better by himself, and there may be some truth in his remark that an old and a young horse can’t pull together in the same cart.

“Superior virtue is not intentionally virtuous, and this is just why it is virtue,”


Standard average European (SAE) languages, for example, have sentences so structured that the verb (event) must be set in motion by the noun (thing)—thereby posing a metaphysical problem as tricky, and probably as meaningless, as that of the relation of mind to body. We cannot talk of “knowing” without assuming that there is some “who” or “what” that knows, not realizing that this is nothing more than a grammatical convention. The supposition that knowing requires a knower is based on a linguistic and not an existential rule, as becomes obvious when we consider that raining needs no rainer and clouding no clouder.


can we think of the heart as separate from the veins, or the branches from the tree? Just what exact delineations distinguish the bee process from the flower process? These distinctions are always somewhat arbitrary and conventional, even when described with very exact language, for the distinctions reside more in the language than in what it describes.

Thus the art of life is not seen as holding to yang and banishing yin, but as keeping the two in balance, because there cannot be one without the other.


Thirty spokes unite at the wheel’s hub; It is the center hole [literally, “from their not being”] that makes it useful. Shape clay into a vessel; It is the space within that makes it useful. Cut out doors and windows for a room; It is the holes which make it useful. Therefore profit comes from what is there; Usefulness from what is not there.


The capacity of mind is broad and huge, like the vast sky. Do not sit with a mind fixed on emptiness. If you do you will fall into a neutral kind of emptiness. Emptiness includes the sun, moon, stars, and planets, the great earth, mountains and rivers, all trees and grasses, bad men and good men, bad things and good things, heaven and hell; they are all in the midst of emptiness. The emptiness of human nature is also like this.7

Let your ears hear whatever they want to hear; let your eyes see whatever they want to see; let your mind think whatever it wants to think; let your lungs breathe in their own rhythm.

Buddha explained language and meaning to Mahamati Bodhisattva: Mahamati, fools say things like this, “Meaning accords with words. Words and meaning are not separate, because meaning has no existence of its own. There is no meaning outside of words.” Mahamati, these benighted people do not know the nature of words. They do not know that words come and go, while meaning does not come and go. Mahamati, words are subject to birth and death. Meaning is not, because it transcends existence and non-existence and is not subject to birth and death and is not an entity. Mahamati, the buddhas do not teach dharmas that are subject to birth or death. Because the existence or non-existence of language is indeterminate, they do not depend upon language but transcend it. Mahamati, if someone says a buddha’s teaching is dependent on language, they are mistaken. Such a teaching transcends language. Therefore, Mahamati, neither I nor any other buddha or bodhisattva utters a single word. And why not? Because everything we teach transcends language. We never fail to teach what accords with meaning, but we do so in accordance with the discriminations of beings. Mahamati, if we did not speak, our teaching would come to an end. And if our teaching came to an end, there would be no buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka-buddhas, or shravakas. And if there were none, who would teach and who would listen?

The Prajnaparamita Sutra Spoken by Manjushri (translated into English by Garma Chang in A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras) in which he tells the Buddha, Those who cultivate Prajnaparamita do not reject the dharmas (truths) of fools, nor do they grasp the dharmas of sages, because in the light of Prajnaparamita, there are no dharmas to be grasped or rejected. Moreover, those who cultivate Prajnaparamita do not delight in nirvana, nor do they detest sansara (life and death), because they do not perceive sansara, much less detest it, nor do they perceive nirvana, much less delight in it. Those who thus cultivate Prajnaparamita do not perceive any defilement to eliminate or any merit to acquire. Their minds neither expand nor contract in regard to any dharma, because they do not perceive expansion or contraction in the dharma realm. Those who can do this cultivate Prajnaparamita.

Truth, in the classic attitude, is a standard for measuring human virtue. As such, it demonstrates an eternal human deficiency, since human virtue exists only in particular human actions, and human actions inevitably involve complex motives, contradictory emotions, and distracting sensations. These things are murky and fluid; they induce moral vertigo in all normal people. The resulting confusion can be temporarily and unsatisfactorily stabilized by deception, irony, and pretense. It can never be escaped. Truth, on the other hand, has no feelings, no emotions, no motives. It exists always without seeking for anything. It is complete in a way that no person ever is. People feel their inadequacies and desires; they have ambitions. Their hungers cannot be permanently satisfied, merely temporarily assuaged.


## The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks, Unknown


RNN computation. So how do these things work? At the core, RNNs have a deceptively simple API: They accept an input vector x and give you an output vector y. However, crucially this output vector’s contents are influenced not only by the input you just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs you’ve fed in in the past.

## Intro to CNN 2, A Deshpande


After each conv layer, it is convention to apply a nonlinear layer (or activation layer) immediately afterward.The purpose of this layer is to introduce nonlinearity to a system that basically has just been computing linear operations during the conv layers (just element wise multiplications and summations).In


pooling layer. It is also referred to as a downsampling layer.


The intuitive reasoning behind this layer is that once we know that a specific feature is in the original input volume (there will be a high activation value), its exact location is not as important as its relative location to the other features.


This layer “drops out” a random set of activations in that layer by setting them to zero. Simple as that. Now, what are the benefits of such a simple and seemingly unnecessary and counterintuitive process? Well, in a way, it forces the network to be redundant. By that I mean the network should be able to provide the right classification or output for a specific example even if some of the activations are dropped out. It makes sure that the network isn’t getting too “fitted” to the training data and thus helps alleviate the overfitting problem.


A network in network layer refers to a conv layer where a 1 x 1 size filter is used.


Transfer learning is the process of taking a pre-trained model (the weights and parameters of a network that has been trained on a large dataset by somebody else) and “fine-tuning” the model with your own dataset. The idea is that this pre-trained model will act as a feature extractor. You will remove the last layer of the network and replace it with your own classifier (depending on what your problem space is). You then freeze the weights of all the other layers and train the network normally (Freezing the layers means not changing the weights during gradient descent/optimization).


Approaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques.

Notes: 1) for example inserting a row or rotating the image etc 


Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations,

a smaller filter size in the first conv layer helps retain a lot of original pixel information in the input volume. A filtering of size 11x11 proved to be skipping a lot of relevant information, especially as this is the first conv layer.

Notes: 1) stride is the amount by which a filter moves in number of pixels. 


Stacking all of these layers and adding huge numbers of filters has a computational and memory cost, as well as an increased chance of overfitting).


No use of fully connected layers! They use an average pool instead, to go from a 7x7x1024 volume to a 1x1x1024 volume. This saves a huge number of parameters.


## Dialogues, Seneca


Let us not therefore decide whither we must tend, and by what path, without the advice of some experienced person who has explored the region which we are about to enter, because this journey is not subject to the same conditions as others; for in them some distinctly understood track and inquiries made of the natives make it impossible for us to go wrong, but here the most beaten and frequented tracks are those which lead us most astray.


Now nothing gets us into greater troubles than our subservience to common rumour, and our habit of thinking that those things are best which are most generally received as such, of taking many counterfeits for truly good things, and of living not by reason but by imitation of others.

Babur was now forty-three years old. Three decades earlier, as a boy-king on the rickety throne of an obscure, war-torn principality, he had dared to dream grand dreams, and now at last, after endless struggles and many misfortunes, he had won a domain to match his vision. Fergana, his ancestral kingdom lost to the Uzbegs, was now a distant memory; Samarkand, the legendary Timurid capital which he had once ardently coveted, a forsaken passion; and Kabul, his capital for twenty-five years, just a provincial outpost.

If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or if you do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it; weep over them, you will also regret it; if you laugh at the world’s follies or if you weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world’s follies or you weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a girl, you will regret it; if you do not believe her, you will also regret it; if you believe a girl or you do not believe her, you will regret both; whether you believe a girl or you do not believe her, you will regret both. If you hang yourself, you will regret it; if you do not hang yourself, you will regret it; if you hang yourself or you do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or you do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum of all practical wisdom. It isn’t just in single moments that I view everything aeterno modo, as Spinoza says; I am constantly aeterno modo.


To be isolated is always to assert oneself numerically; when you assert yourself as one, that is isolation. I’m sure all friends of association will concur with me in this, even if they are incapable of seeing that just the same isolation obtains when hundreds want to assert themselves as nothing but hundreds. To a number itself the number is always a matter of indifference, whether it is one or a thousand or the whole world’s population specified merely as a number.


Our age certainly has one peculiarity to a greater degree than Greece, namely that it is more melancholy and hence deeper in despair. Our age is thus melancholy enough to realize there is something called responsibility and that it has some significance. So while everyone wants to rule, no one wants the responsibility.


It is still fresh in our memory that a French statesman, on being offered a portfolio for a second time, declared that he would accept on the condition that the secretary of state be made responsible.

In 1997, 42 percent of the population of both India and China were living in extreme poverty. By 2017, in India, that share had dropped to 12 percent: there were 270 million fewer people living in extreme poverty than there had been just 20 years earlier. In China, that share dropped to a stunning 0.7 percent over the same period, meaning another half a billion people over this crucial threshold.

Bootstrapping is the impossible task of lifting yourself into the air by pulling really, really hard on your bootstraps. The idea entered computer jargon (booting or rebooting) to describe how computers wake up from the dead and then load instructions telling them what to do next.


Isaac Newton saw God as the “first cause” of everything and argued that He was present in all of space. That is why Newton thought that the universe as a whole did not change much. The universe, he once wrote, was “the Sensorium of a Being incorporeal, living, and intelligent.”1 Early in the twentieth century, Einstein was so sure the universe was unchanging (at large scales) that he added a special constant to his theory of relativity to make it predict a stable universe.

But quantum physics tells us, and particle accelerators—which speed up subatomic particles to high velocities by means of electric or electromagnetic fields—show us, that something really can appear in a vacuum from nothing, though grasping what this means requires a sophisticated understanding of nothing. In modern quantum physics, it is impossible to determine precisely the position and motion of subatomic particles. This means you can never say for sure that a particular region of space is empty, and that means that emptiness is tense with the possibility that something might appear. Like the “neither non-existence nor existence” of the Indian Vedas, this tension seems to have bootstrapped our universe.


with so much energy squashed up inside it, the primordial atom had to be inconceivably hot and had to be expanding like crazy to relieve the pressure.

Notes: 1) Like we have to expand to infinity to Get our energies released , there is no other way!! Fighting, anger etc can never satify our nature's demand of energy release...expansion is the only way. We cant expand externally so internal expansions is the path to tranqulity or equilibrium . 


We normally think of hydrogen and oxygen as colorless gases. But join two hydrogen atoms to a single oxygen atom in a particular configuration, and you get a molecule of water. Put lots of those molecules together, and you get the utterly new quality that we think of as “wateriness.”

Gravity is weak, but it reaches across vast distances and always pulls things together, so its power accumulates. It tends to make the universe more clumpy. Electromagnetic energy comes in negative and positive forms, so it often cancels itself out. Gravity, though puny, shapes the universe on a large scale. But electromagnetism dominates at the level of chemistry and biology, so it’s what holds our bodies together. The third and fourth fundamental forces are known, unexcitingly, as the strong and weak nuclear forces. They reach over tiny distances, so they matter on a subatomic scale. We humans don’t experience them directly, but they shape every aspect of our world because they determine what happens deep inside atoms.


antigravity that is present in all of space, so its power increases as the universe expands. Today, the mass of this energy may account for as much as 70 percent of the total mass of the universe.

The first law of thermodynamics tells us that the ocean of energy is always there; it’s conserved. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that all the forms that emerge will eventually dissolve back into the ocean of energy. The forms, like the movements of a dance, are not conserved.

there will be gravity in this universe, and electromagnetism as well, and electromagnetism is going to be 1036 times as strong as gravity.” (That really is the ratio of the strength of gravity and electromagnetism, at least in our universe.) The existence of these rules ensured that our universe would never be totally chaotic.


heat is really a measure of the motion of atoms. All particles of matter are constantly jiggling about with energy, like nervous children, and temperature is a measure of the average degree of jiggling. The jiggling is real. In a famous paper published in 1905, Einstein showed that the jiggling of atoms causes the random gyrations of dust particles in the air.


If an object, such as a motorbike, is making a noise and moving toward you, the frequency of the sound waves will seem to increase, and your ears will interpret the higher frequency as a higher pitch. After it passes you, the pitch will seem to drop, because now the waves are being stretched out. The rider, of course, is not moving relative to the motorbike and keeps hearing the same pitch. The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency of electromagnetic emissions

When the water from a waterfall smashes into rocks at the bottom, it turns into the scattered, incoherent energy of heat. Every molecule jiggles around more or less independently. The energy is still there; it’s still conserved (that’s the first law). But the molecules push in so many directions that their energy can no longer drive a turbine. Free energy has turned into heat energy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that, in the very long run, all free energy will turn into heat energy.


Newton saw gravity as a universal force of attraction that operated between all masses. Two and a half centuries later, Einstein showed that energy could also exert a gravitational pull, because energy is what matter is made from.


On Earth, each LIGO machine split beams of light in two and sent them traveling at right angles to each other up and down two four-kilometer tubes with mirrors at either end. When they returned after almost three hundred trips, they didn’t arrive at exactly the same time. Tiny gravitational waves had stretched the tubes in one direction and shrunk them in the other by a distance much less than the width of a proton.

Notes: 1) Anaximander 


This is how time is depicted in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. His equations do not have a single “time”; they have innumerable times. Between two events, just as between the two clocks that are separated and then brought together again, the duration is not a single one.8 Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.*


We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps.


We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible. . . . Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.


All of the sons of Adam are part of one single body, They are of the same essence. When time afflicts us with pain In one part of that body All the other parts feel it too. If you fail to feel the pain of others You do not deserve the name of man.

The crucial point here is the difference from what happens with falling bodies: a ball may fall, but it can also come back up, by rebounding, for instance. Heat cannot. This is the only basic law of physics that distinguishes the past from the future.


Clausius introduces a quantity that measures this irreversible progress of heat in only one direction and, since he was a cultivated German, he gives it a name taken from ancient Greek—entropy:


Clausius’s entropy, indicated by the letter S, is a measurable and calculable quantity 15 that increases or remains the same but never decreases, in an isolated process. In order to indicate that it never decreases, we write: ΔS ≥ 0 This reads: “Delta S is always greater than or equal to zero,” and we call this “the second principle of thermodynamics”


It is the only equation of fundamental physics that knows any difference between past and future. The only one that speaks of the flowing of time. Behind this unusual equation, an entire world lies hidden.


The question now becomes: why, in one of the two directions of time—the one we call past—were things more ordered? Why was the great pack of cards of the universe in order in the past? Why, in the past, was entropy lower? If we observe a phenomenon that begins in a state of lower entropy, it is clear why entropy increases—because in the process of reshuffling, everything becomes disordered. But why do the phenomena that we observe around us in the cosmos begin in a state of lower entropy in the first place?


He has demonstrated that entropy is precisely the quantity that counts how many are the different configurations that our blurred vision does not distinguish between.


Time passes more slowly for the one who keeps moving.


“Proper time” depends not only on where you are and your degree of proximity to masses; it depends also on the speed at which you move.


if you look at your sister, you are receiving light that travels from her to your eyes. The light takes time to reach you, let’s say a few nanoseconds—a tiny fraction of a second—therefore, you are not quite seeing what she is doing now but what she was doing a few nanoseconds ago.


Our “present” does not extend throughout the universe. It is like a bubble around us.


A partial order establishes a relation of before and after between certain elements, but not between any two of them. Human beings form a “partially ordered” set (not a “completely ordered” set) through filiation. Filiation establishes an order (before the descendants, after the forebears), but not between everyone.


Every event has its past, its future, and a part of the universe that is neither past nor future, just as every person has forebears, descendants, and others who are neither forebears nor descendants.


a common present does not exist: the temporal structure of spacetime is not a stratification of times such as this: It is, rather, a structure made up entirely of light cones: This is the structure of spacetime that Einstein understood when he was twenty-five years old. Ten years later, he comes to understand that the speed at which time flows changes from place to place. It follows that spacetime does not really have the order outlined above but can be distorted. It now looks rather more like this: When a gravitational wave passes, for example, the small light cones oscillate together from right to left, like ears of wheat blown by the wind. The structure of the cones can even be such that, advancing always toward the future, one can return to the same point in spacetime, like this: In this way, a continuous trajectory toward the future returns to the originating event, to where it began.*32 The first to realize this was Kurt Gödel, the great twentieth-century logician who was Einstein’s last friend, accompanying him on walks along the streets of Princeton.

Near to a black hole, the lines converge toward it, like this:33 This is because the mass of the black hole slows time to such a degree that, at its border (called the “horizon”), time stands still. If you look closely, you will see that the surface of the black hole is parallel to the edges of the cones. So, in order to exit from a black hole, you would need to move (like the trajectory marked in dark gray in the following diagram) toward the present rather than toward the future! This is impossible. Objects can only move toward the future, as in the trajectories outlined in the diagram in white. This is what constitutes a black hole: an inclination of the light cones toward the interior, marking a horizon, closing off a region of space in the future from everything that surrounds it. It is nothing other than this. It is the curious local structure of the present that produces black holes.

“How long is forever?” asks Alice. “Sometimes, just one second,” replies the White Rabbit.


But for most of those centuries, however, hours were longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, because the twelve hours divided the time between dawn and sunset: the first hour was dawn, and the twelfth was sunset, regardless of the season, as we read in the parable of the winegrower in the Gospel according to Matthew.


A train station in Paris kept its own hour, a little behind the rest of the city, as a kind of courtesy toward travelers running late.39


There are chemical mechanisms that keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even in the biochemistry of single cells.


Aristotle is the first we are aware of to have asked himself the question “What is time?,” and he came to the following conclusion: time is the measurement of change.


“true” time that passes regardless, independently of things and of their changes. If all things remained motionless and even the movements of our souls were to be frozen, this time would continue to pass, according to Newton, unaffected and equal to itself: “true” time. It’s the exact opposite of what Aristotle writes.


Aristotle: Time is nothing other than the measurement of change.


time that is “absolute, true, and mathematical,” assumed by Newton to run independently of things that change or things that move.


the existence of a time that is uniform, independent of things and of their movement that today seems so natural to us is not an ancient intuition that is natural to humanity itself. It’s an idea of Newton’s.


time (the measure of “when” with regard to events, as Aristotle wanted; the entity that runs even when nothing happens, according to Newton)


Aristotle was the first to discuss in depth and with acuity the meaning of “space,” or “place,” and to arrive at a precise definition: the place of a thing is what surrounds that thing.


The synthesis between Aristotle’s time and Newton’s is the most valuable achievement made by Einstein. It is the crowning jewel of his thought.


The answer is that the time and space Newton had intuited the existence of, beyond tangible matter, do effectively exist. They are real. Time and space are real phenomena. But they are in no way absolute; they are not at all independent from what happens; they are not as different from the other substances of the world, as Newton had imagined them to be. We can think of a great Newtonian canvas on which the story of the world is drawn. But this canvas is made of the same stuff that everything else in the world is made of, the same substance that constitutes stone, light, and air: it is made of fields.

Remember the clocks in chapter 1 that slow down in the vicinity of a mass? They slow down because there is, in a precise sense, “less” gravitational field there. There is less time there.


You will obtain something like the image below, which represents space (the height, on the vertical axis) and time (on the horizontal)—but, now, the “longer” time in the mountains effectively corresponds to a greater length of time. The image above illustrates what physicists call “curved” spacetime. “Curved” because it is distorted: distances are stretched and contracted, just like the elastic sheet when it is pulled. This is why the light cones were inclined in the diagrams in chapter 3. Time thus becomes part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space. This is the synthesis that Einstein found between Aristotle’s conception of time and Newton’s. With a tremendous beat of his wings, Einstein understands that Aristotle and Newton are both right. Newton is right in intuiting that something else exists in addition to the simple things that we see moving and changing. True and mathematical Newtonian time exists; it is a real entity; it is the gravitational field, the elastic sheet, the curved spacetime in the diagram. But Newton is wrong in assuming that this time is independent from things—and that it passes regularly, imperturbably, separately, from everything else. For his part, Aristotle is right to say that “when” and “where” are always located in relation to something. But this something can also be just the field, the spatiotemporal entity of Einstein. Because this is a dynamic and concrete entity, like all those in reference to which, as Aristotle rightly observed, we are capable of locating ourselves.


The “quantization” of time implies that almost all values of time t do not exist. If we could measure the duration of an interval with the most precise clock imaginable, we should find that the time measured takes only certain discrete, special values.


Granularity is ubiquitous in nature: light is made of photons, the particles of light. The energy of electrons in atoms can acquire only certain values and not others. The purest air is granular, and so, too, is the densest matter. Once it is understood that Newton’s space and time are physical entities like all others, it is natural to suppose that they are also granular.


it is not possible to predict exactly, for instance, where an electron will appear tomorrow. Between one appearance and another, the electron has no precise position,55 as if it were dispersed in a cloud of probability.


the electron is concrete only in relation to the other physical objects it is interacting with.


It is hard to take in the idea that an electron behaves in such a bizarre way. It is even more difficult to digest that this is also the way time and space behave. And yet, according to all the evidence, this is the way the quantum world works: the world that we inhabit.


The substratum that determines the duration of time is not an independent entity, different from the others that make up the world; it is an aspect of a dynamic field. It jumps, fluctuates, materializes only by interacting, and is not to be found beneath a minimum scale. . . . So, after all this, what is left of time?


None of the pieces that time has lost (singularity, direction, independence, the present, continuity) puts into question the fact that the world is a network of events. On the one hand, there was time, with its many determinations; on the other,


None of the pieces that time has lost (singularity, direction, independence, the present, continuity) puts into question the fact that the world is a network of events. On the one hand, there was time, with its many determinations; on the other, the simple fact that nothing is: things happen.


The events of the world do not form an orderly queue, like the English. They crowd around chaotically, like Italians.


The difference between things and events is that things persist in time; events have a limited duration. A stone is a prototypical “thing”: we can ask ourselves where it will be tomorrow. Conversely, a kiss is an “event.” It makes no sense to ask where the kiss will be tomorrow. The world is made up of networks of kisses, not of stones.


to—Anaximander’s exhortation remains valid: we understand the world by studying change, not by studying things.


to—Anaximander’s exhortation remains valid: we understand the world by studying change, not by studying things. Those who have neglected this good advice have paid a heavy price for it. Two of the greats who fell into this error were Plato and Kepler, both curiously seduced by the same mathematics.


The fact that we cannot arrange the universe like a single orderly sequence of times does not mean that nothing changes. It means that changes are not arranged in a single orderly succession: the temporal structure of the world is more complex than a simple single linear succession of instants. This does not mean that it is nonexistent or illusory.


Nature, for its part, is what it is—and we discover it very gradually.


The relations of spatial adjacency tie the grains of space into webs. We call these “spin networks.” The name “spin” comes from the mathematics that describe the grains of space.75 A ring in the spin network is called a “loop,” and these are the loops that give “loop theory” its name.


There is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to weep and a time to dance, a time to kill and a time to heal. A time to destroy and a time to build.


A group of boys on a field decide to have a match. They form teams. This is how we used to do it: the two most enterprising would take turns choosing the players they wanted, having tossed a coin to see who would have first pick. At the end of this solemn procedure, there were two teams. Where were the teams before they were chosen? Nowhere. They emerged from the procedure.


In the mountains, we see a valley covered by a sea of white clouds. The surface of the clouds gleams, immaculate. We start to walk toward the valley. The air becomes more humid, then less clear; the sky is no longer blue. We find ourselves in a fog. Where did the well-defined surface of the clouds go? It vanished. Its disappearance is gradual; there is no surface that separates the fog from the sparse air of the heights. Was it an illusion? No, it was a view from afar. Come to think of it, it’s like this with all surfaces. This dense marble table would look like a fog if I were shrunk to a small enough, atomic scale. Everything in the world becomes blurred when seen close up.

something that is real—a cat, a football team, high and low, the surface of clouds, the rotation of the cosmos—emerges from a world that at a much simpler level has no cats, teams, up or down, no surfaces of clouds, no revolving cosmos. . . . Time emerges from a world without time, in a way that has something in common with each of these examples.

PERSPECTIVE


Between ourselves and the rest of the world there are physical interactions. Obviously, not all the variables of the world interact with us, or with the segment of the world to which we belong. Only a very minute fraction of these variables does so; most of them do not react with us at all. They do not register us, and we do not register them. This is why distinct configurations of the world seem equivalent to us. The physical interaction between myself and a glass of water—two pieces of the world—is independent of the motion of the single molecules of water. In the same way, the physical interaction between myself and a distant galaxy—two pieces of the world—ignores what happens in detail out there. Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. This blurring is at the heart of Boltzmann’s theory.93 From this blurring, the concepts of heat and entropy are born—and these are linked to the phenomena that characterize the flow of time. The entropy of a system depends explicitly on blurring. It depends on what I do not register, because it depends on the number of indistinguishable configurations. The same microscopic configuration may be of high entropy with regard to one blurring and of low in relation to another.


Take a pack of twelve cards, six red and six black. Arrange it so that the red cards are all at the front. Shuffle the pack a little and then look for the black cards that have ended up among the red ones. Before shuffling, there are none; after, some. This is a basic example of the growth of entropy. At the start of the game, the number of black cards among the red in the first half of the pack is zero (the entropy is low) because it has started in a special configuration.


It is what philosophers call “indexicality”: the characteristic of certain words that have a different meaning every time they are used, a meaning determined by where, how, when, and by whom they are being spoken. Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.


WHAT EMERGES FROM A PARTICULARITY


Why do the tall pine and the pale poplar intertwine their branches to provide such sweet shade for us? Why does the fleeting water invent bright spirals in the turbulent stream?


But there is something that does not add up. Energy—as I was also told at school—is conserved. It is neither created nor destroyed. If it is conserved, why do we have to constantly resupply it? Why can’t we just keep using the same energy? The truth is that there is plenty of energy and it is not consumed. It’s not energy that the world needs in order to keep going. What it needs is low entropy. Energy (be it mechanical, chemical, electrical, or potential) transforms itself into thermal energy, that is to say, into heat: it goes into cold things, and there is no free way of getting it back from there to reuse it to make a plant grow, or to power a motor. In this process, the energy remains the same but the entropy increases, and it is this which cannot be turned back. The second law of thermodynamics demands it. What makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium—there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen. Near to the Earth we have a rich source of low entropy: the sun. The sun sends us hot photons. Then the Earth radiates heat toward the black sky, emitting colder photons. The energy that enters is more or less equal to the energy that exits; consequently, we do not generally gain energy in the exchange. (Gaining energy in the exchange is disastrous for us: it is global warming.) But for every hot photon that arrives, the Earth emits ten cold ones, since a hot photon from the sun has the same energy as ten cold photons emitted by the Earth. The hot photon has less entropy than the ten cold photons, because the number of configurations of a single (hot) photon is lower than the number of configurations of ten (cold) photons. Therefore, the sun is a continual rich source of low entropy for us. We have at our disposal an abundance of low entropy, and it is this that allows plants and animals to grow, enables us to build motors and cities—and to think and to write books such as this one.


A pile of wood, for example, lasts a long time if left alone. It is not in a state of maximum entropy, because the elements of which it is made, such as carbon and hydrogen, are combined in a very particular manner (“ordered”) to give form to the wood. Entropy grows if these particular combinations are broken down. This is what happens when wood burns: its elements disengage from the particular structures that form wood and entropy increases sharply (fire being, in fact, a markedly irreversible process).


A stone falls to the ground. Why? One often reads that it’s because the stone places itself “in a state of lower energy” that it ends up lower down. But why does the stone put itself into a state of lower energy? Why should it lose energy if energy is conserved? The answer is that when the stone hits the Earth, it warms it: its mechanical energy is transformed into heat. And there is no way back from there. If the second law of thermodynamics did not exist, if heat did not exist, if there existed no microscopic swarming, the stone would rebound perpetually; it would never land and be still. It is entropy, not energy, that keeps stones on the ground and the world turning.


spreads.99 What causes events to happen in the world, what writes its history, is the irresistible mixing of all things, going from the few ordered configurations to the countless disordered ones. The entire universe is like a mountain that collapses in slow motion. Like a structure that very gradually crumbles. From the most minute events to the more complex ones, it is this dance of ever-increasing entropy, nourished by the initial low entropy of the universe, that is the real dance of Shiva, the destroyer.


Are the wheels the chariot? Is the axle? Is the chassis the chariot? Is the chariot the sum of its parts? The king replies cautiously that certainly “chariot” refers only to the relationship among the ensemble of wheels, axle, and chassis, to their working together and in relation to us—and that there does not exist an entity “chariot” beyond these relations and events. Nāgasena triumphs: in the same way as “chariot,” the name “Nāgasena” designates nothing more than a collection of relations and events.

what is it that founds our identity and its unity? What makes it so—that I am Carlo—and that my hair and my nails and my feet are considered part of me, as well as my anger and my dreams, and that I consider myself to be the same Carlo as yesterday, the same as tomorrow; the one who thinks, suffers, and perceives? There are different ingredients that combine to produce our identity. Three of these are important for the argument of this book:


We are histories of ourselves, narratives.


We are histories of ourselves, narratives. I am not this momentary mass of flesh reclined on the sofa typing the letter a on my laptop; I am my thoughts full of the traces of the phrases that I am writing; I am my mother’s caresses, and the serene kindness with which my father calmly guided me; I am my adolescent travels; I am what my reading has deposited in layers in my mind; I am my loves, my moments of despair, my friendships, what I’ve written, what I’ve heard; the faces engraved on my memory. I am, above all, the one who a minute ago made a cup of tea for himself. The one who a moment ago typed the word “memory” into his computer. The one who just composed the sentence that I am now completing. If all this disappeared, would I still exist? I am this long, ongoing novel. My life consists of it. It


It is within my mind, then, that I measure time. I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective. When I measure time, I am measuring something in the present of my mind. Either this is time, or I have no idea what time is.


Augustine’s exposition of the idea is quite beautiful. It is based on our experience of music. When we listen to a hymn, the meaning of a sound is given by the ones that come before and after it. Music can occur only in time, but if we are always in the present moment, how is it possible to hear it? It is possible, Augustine observes, because our consciousness is based on memory and on anticipation. A hymn, a song, is in some way present in our minds in a unified form, held together by something—by that which we take time to be. And hence this is what time is: it is entirely in the present, in our minds, as memory and as anticipation.

Notes: 1) Since hymns arr metaphorical, our mind predicts the future words and adjusts the meanings of past and the presednt words. Some hymns seem extremly beautiful if it is the last word which changes our predicted meaning. An element of surprise is what makes poetry so beautiful. 


Synapses are continually formed in their thousands and then erased—especially during sleep, leaving behind a blurry reflection of that which has acted on our nervous system in the past.


What causes us to suffer is not in the past or the future: it is here, now, in our memory, in our expectations. We long for timelessness, we endure the passing of time: we suffer time. Time is suffering.

The closer we are to a mass (chapter 1), or the faster we move (chapter 3), the more time slows down: there is no single duration between two events; there are many possible ones.


The closer we are to a mass (chapter 1), or the faster we move (chapter 3), the more time slows down: there is no single duration between two events; there are many possible ones. The rhythms at which time flows are determined by the gravitational field, a real entity with its own dynamic that is described in the equations of Einstein.


In the elementary grammar of the world, there is neither space nor time—only processes that transform physical quantities from one to another, from which it is possible to calculate probabilities and relations


In the elementary grammar of the world, there is neither space nor time—only processes that transform physical quantities from one to another, from which it is possible to calculate probabilities and relations (chapter 5). At the most fundamental level that we currently know of, therefore, there is little that resembles time as we experience it. There is no special variable “time,” there is no difference between past and future, there is no spacetime


Perhaps we belong to a particular subset of the world that interacts with the rest of it in such a way that this entropy is lower in one direction of our thermal time. The directionality of time is therefore real but perspectival (chapter 10): the entropy of the world in relation to us increases with our thermal time. We see the occurrence of things ordered in this variable, which we simply call “time,” and the growth of entropy distinguishes the past from the future for us and leads to the unfolding of the cosmos. It determines the existence of traces, residues, and memories of the past


When we cannot formulate a problem with precision, it is often not because the problem is profound: it’s because the problem is false.


We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come. The clearing that is opened up in this way, by memory and by anticipation, is time: a source of anguish sometimes, but in the end a tremendous gift.


(“The Earth has lost its youthfulness; it is past, like a happy dream. Now every day brings us closer to destruction, to desert,” as Vyasa has it in the Mahābhārata.


We think of the world in terms of stones, mountains, clouds, and people, and this is “the world for us.” About the world independent of us we know a good deal, without knowing how much this good deal is.


order to make advances in our understanding of the world, it is not always necessary to have new data. Copernicus had no more observational data than Ptolemy: he was able to deduce heliocentrism from the data available to Ptolemy by interpreting it better—as Einstein did with regard to Maxwell.

One way to keep a model’s overall complexity in check is to introduce a penalty parameter, in a step known as regularization. This new parameter penalizes any increase in a model’s complexity by artificially inflating prediction error, thus enabling the algorithm to account for both complexity and accuracy in optimizing its original parameters.


## The Courage To Be Disliked: How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness, Ichiro Kishimi


None of us live in an objective world, but instead in a subjective world that we ourselves have given meaning to. The world you see is different from the one I see, and it’s impossible to share your world with anyone else.


At present, the world seems complicated and mysterious to you, but if you change, the world will appear more simple. The issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are.


But why does everyone feel they want to change? There’s only one answer: because they cannot change. If it were easy for people to change, they wouldn’t spend so much time wishing they could. No matter how much they wish it, people cannot change. And that’s why there are always so many people getting taken in by new religions and dubious self-help seminars, and any preaching on how everyone can change. Am I wrong? PHILOSOPHER: Well, in response, I’d ask why you are so adamant that people can’t change.


‘Before an effect, there’s a cause.’


If we focus only on past causes and try to explain things solely through cause and effect, we end up with ‘determinism’. Because what this says is that our present and our future have already been decided by past occurrences, and are unalterable.


Freud’s idea is that a person’s psychic wounds (traumas) cause his or her present unhappiness. When you treat a person’s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality and sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive.


Freud’s idea is that a person’s psychic wounds (traumas) cause his or her present unhappiness. When you treat a person’s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality and sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive. But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: ‘No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.’


If we proceed with your reasoning, any offence committed in anger can be blamed on anger, and will no longer be the responsibility of the person because, essentially, you are saying that people cannot control their emotions.


One day, a mother and daughter were quarrelling loudly. Then, suddenly, the telephone rang. ‘Hello?’ The mother picked up the receiver hurriedly, her voice still thick with anger. The caller was her daughter’s homeroom teacher. As soon as the mother realised who was phoning, the tone of her voice changed and she became very polite. Then, for the next five minutes or so, she carried on a conversation in her best telephone voice.

The caller was her daughter’s homeroom teacher. As soon as the mother realised who was phoning, the tone of her voice changed and she became very polite. Then, for the next five minutes or so, she carried on a conversation in her best telephone voice. Once she hung up, in a moment, her expression changed again and she went straight back to yelling at her daughter. YOUTH: Well, that’s not a particularly unusual story. PHILOSOPHER: Don’t you see? In a word, anger is a tool that can be taken out as needed. It can be put away the moment the phone rings, and pulled out again after one hangs up. The mother isn’t yelling in anger she cannot control. She is simply using the anger to overpower her daughter with a loud voice, and thereby assert her opinions.


The first step to change is knowing.


Answers from others are nothing more than stopgap measures; they’re of no value.


you are unable to really feel happy, then it’s clear that things aren’t right just as they are. You’ve got to put one foot in front of the other, and not stop.


‘The important thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that equipment.’


We are not replaceable machines. It is not replacement we need, but renewal.


Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life.


After all that then, why are you still unable to change? It is because you are making the persistent decision not to change your lifestyle.


When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our great courage to the test. There is the anxiety generated by changing, and the disappointment attendant to not changing.


Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage. Your unhappiness cannot be blamed on your past or your environment. And it isn’t that you lack competence. You just lack courage. One might say you are lacking in the courage to be happy.


Adler says, ‘To get rid of one’s problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone.’ But one can’t do such a thing.


it is only in social contexts that a person becomes an ‘individual’.


someone far across the ocean. Even if you spend


the problems that people experience are interpersonal relationship problems. Adler


Adler’s native German, the word is Minderwertigkeitsgefühl, which means a feeling (Gefühl) of having less (minder) worth (Wert). So, ‘feeling of inferiority’ is a term that has to do with one’s value judgement of oneself.


there is one good thing about subjectivity: it allows you to make your own choice.


We cannot alter objective facts. But subjective interpretations can be altered as much as one likes. And we are inhabitants of a subjective world.


value is something that’s based on a social context. The value given to a one-dollar bill is not an objectively attributed value, though that might be a commonsense approach. If one considers its actual cost as printed material, the value is nowhere near a dollar.


The problem of value in the end brings us back to interpersonal relationships again.


One makes a show of being on good terms with a powerful person (broadly speaking—it could be anyone from the leader of your school class to a famous celebrity). And by doing that, one lets it be known that one is special. Behaviours like misrepresenting one’s work experience or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing are forms of giving


One makes a show of being on good terms with a powerful person (broadly speaking—it could be anyone from the leader of your school class to a famous celebrity). And by doing that, one lets it be known that one is special. Behaviours like misrepresenting one’s work experience or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing are forms of giving authority, and probably also have aspects of the superiority complex.

And by doing that, one lets it be known that one is special. Behaviours like misrepresenting one’s work experience or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing are forms of giving authority, and probably also have aspects of the superiority complex. In each case, it isn’t that the ‘I’ is actually superior or special. It is only that one is making the ‘I’ look superior by linking it to authority. In short, it’s a fabricated feeling of superiority. YOUTH: And at the base of that, there is an intense feeling of inferiority?

In short, it’s a fabricated feeling of superiority. YOUTH: And at the base of that, there is an intense feeling of inferiority? PHILOSOPHER: Of course.


Adler clearly indicates, ‘The one who boasts does so only out of a feeling of inferiority.’


Adler says, ‘In fact, if we were to ask ourselves who is the strongest person in our culture, the logical answer would be the baby. The baby rules and cannot be dominated.’ The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And


Of course, the words of the person who has been hurt—‘You don’t understand how I feel’—are likely to contain a certain degree of truth. Completely understanding the feelings of the person who is suffering is something that no one is capable of. But as long as one continues to use one’s misfortune to one’s advantage in order to be ‘special’, one will always need that misfortune.


Adler does not uphold such attitudes, of course. Rather, he’s saying that on the same level playing field, there are people who are moving forward, and there are people who are moving forward behind them. Keep that image in mind.


The reason that so many people don’t really feel happy while they’re building up their success in the eyes of society is that they are living in competition. Because to them, the world is a perilous place that is overflowing with enemies.


You think of interpersonal relationships as competition; you perceive other people’s happiness as ‘my defeat’, and that is why you can’t celebrate it.


In the teachings of Judaism, one finds a view that goes something like this: if you are not living your life for yourself, then who is going to live it for you? You are living only your own life. When it comes to who you are living it for, of course it’s you. And then, if you are not living your life for yourself, who could there be to live it instead of you? Ultimately, we live thinking about ‘I’. There is no reason that we must not think that way.


I suppose that ‘God is watching’ might serve as a criterion for self-discipline. If one were recognised by God, maybe one didn’t need recognition from others. But that era ended a long time ago.


If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, and one is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself, and continuing that lying to include the people around one.


Not wanting to be disliked by other people. To human beings, this is an entirely natural desire, and an impulse. Kant, the giant of modern philosophy, called this desire ‘inclination’.


A stone is powerless. Once it has begun to roll downhill, it will continue to roll until released from the natural laws of gravity and inertia. But we are not stones. We are beings who are capable of resisting inclination. We can stop our tumbling selves and climb uphill. The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire. So, are you going to keep rolling downhill in order to receive recognition from others? Are you going to wear yourself down like a rolling stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left is a little round ball, would that be ‘the real I’? It cannot be.


‘freedom is being disliked by other people’.


don’t be afraid of being disliked.


‘Not wanting to be disliked’ is probably my task, but whether or not so-and-so dislikes me is the other person’s task. Even if there is a person who doesn’t think well of me, I cannot intervene in that. To borrow from the proverb I mentioned earlier, naturally one would make the effort to lead a horse to water. But whether he drinks or not is that person’s task.


The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked.


way of living in which one is constantly troubled by how one is seen by others is a self-centred lifestyle in which one’s sole concern is with the ‘I’.


That person didn’t do anything for me; That person let me down; That person isn’t my comrade anymore. He’s my enemy. People who hold the belief that they are the centre of the world always end up losing their comrades before long.


Say he goes out to buy a loaf of bread. He pays for it with a coin. That coin does not simply go back to the bakers of the bread. It goes to the producers of flour and butter; to the people who deliver those ingredients; to the purveyors of the gasoline used by the delivery vehicles; to people in the oil-producing countries where that fuel comes from, and so on. So, it’s all connected. People are never truly alone or separate from community, and cannot be.


A community that you can break relations with by simply submitting a withdrawal notice is one that you can have only so much connection to, in any case. Once you know how big the world is, you will see that all the hardship you went through in school was a storm in a teacup. The moment you leave the teacup, that raging storm will be gone, and a gentle breeze will greet you in its place.


Though this might be termed a ‘you and I’ relationship, if it is one that can break down just because you raise an objection, then it is not the sort of relationship you need to get into in the first place. It is fine to just let go of it. Living in fear of one’s relationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people.


You’re saying to choose freedom at the same time that I have community feeling? PHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course. Do not cling to the small community right in front of you. There will always be more ‘you and I’, and more ‘everyone’, and larger communities that exist.


The more one is praised by another person, the more one forms the belief that one has no ability. Please do your best to remember this.


Because giving praise is a judgement that is passed by a person of ability onto a person without ability.


You convey words of gratitude, saying thank you to this partner who has helped you with your work. You might express straightforward delight: ‘I’m glad.’ Or you could convey your thanks by saying, ‘That was a big help.’ This is an approach to encouragement that is based on horizontal relationships.


In Adler’s view, ‘It is only when a person is able to feel that he has worth that he can possess courage.’


Adler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality. Namely, that the feeling of ‘I am beneficial to the community’ or ‘I am of use to someone’ is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has worth.


When one adopts the point of view of Freudian aetiology, one sees life as a kind of great big story based on cause and effect. So, then, it’s all about where and when I was born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. And that decides who I am now, and who I will become. To be sure, likening one’s life to a story is probably an entertaining job. The problem is, one can see the dimness that lies ahead at the end of the story. Moreover, one will try to lead a life that is in line with that story. And then one says, my life is such-and-such, so I have no choice but to live this way, and it’s not because of me—it’s my past, it’s the environment, and so on. But bringing up the past here is nothing but a way out, a life-lie. However, life is a series of dots, a series of moments.

one wants to get into a university, but one makes no attempt to study. This an attitude of not living earnestly here and now. Of course, maybe the entrance examination is still far off. Maybe one is not sure what needs to be studied or how thoroughly, and one finds it troublesome. However, it is enough to do it little by little—every day one can work out some mathematical formulas; one can memorise some words. In short, one can dance the dance. By doing so, one is sure to have a sense of ‘this is what I did today’; this is what today, this single day, was for. Clearly, today is not for an entrance examination in the distant future.


The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and the future, cast a dim light on one’s entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something. Until now, you have turned away from the here and now, and only shone a light on invented pasts and futures. You have told a great lie to your life, to these irreplaceable moments.


‘Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.’


Adler: ‘Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.’


## Seneca's Letters From a Stoic, Lucius Annaeus Seneca


certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness.


For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.


Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.

Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.


But if you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means.


As to yourself, although you should live in such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could not entrust even to your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which convention keeps secret, you should share with a friend at least all your worries and reflections.


but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.


No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed.


Something of that which I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again.

pray for a sound mind and for good health, first of soul and then of body. And of course you should offer those prayers frequently. Call boldly upon God; you will not be asking him for that which belongs to another.


Athenodorus: "Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou hast reached such a point that thou prayest to God for nothing except what thou canst pray for openly." But how foolish men are now! They whisper the basest of prayers to heaven; but if anyone listens, they are silent at once. That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate to God. Do you not think, then, that some such wholesome advice as this could be given you: "Live among men as if God beheld you; speak with God as if men were listening"?


There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.


The mind at times fashions for itself false shapes of evil when there are no signs that point to any evil; it twists into the worst construction some word of doubtful meaning; or it fancies some personal grudge to be more serious than it really is, considering


And if fear wins a majority of the votes, incline in the other direction anyhow, and cease to harass your soul, reflecting continually that most mortals, even when no troubles are actually at hand or are certainly to be expected in the future, become excited and disquieted.

Fix a limit which you will not even desire to pass, should you have the power.


Examine yourself; scrutinize and observe yourself in divers ways; but mark, before all else, whether it is in philosophy or merely in life itself that you have made progress.


Countless things that happen every hour call for advice; and such advice is to be sought in philosophy.


philosophy ought to be our defence. She will encourage us to obey God cheerfully, but Fortune defiantly; she will


philosophy ought to be our defence. She will encourage us to obey God cheerfully, but Fortune defiantly; she will teach us to follow God and endure Chance.


you should not allow the impulse of your spirit to weaken and grow cold. Hold fast to it and establish it firmly, in order that what is now impulse may become a habit of the mind.


Epicurus: "If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich." 8. Nature's wants are slight; the demands of opinion are boundless.


When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end; but when astray, your wanderings are limitless.


When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end; but when astray, your wanderings are limitless. Recall your steps, therefore, from idle things, and when you would know whether that which you seek is based upon a natural or upon a misleading desire, consider whether it can stop at any definite point. If you find, after having travelled far, that there is a more distant goal always in view, you may be sure that this condition is contrary to nature.


For he alone is in kinship with God who has scorned wealth. Of course I do not forbid you to possess it, but I would have you reach the point at which you possess it dauntlessly; this can be accomplished only by persuading yourself that you can live happily without it as well


I leap for joy whenever I receive letters from you. For they fill me with hope; they are now not mere assurances concerning you, but guarantees.


If you retreat to privacy, everything will be on a smaller scale, but you will be satisfied abundantly;


consider that it is more important who receives a thing, than what it is he receives.


When I urge you so strongly to your studies, it is my own interest which I am consulting; I want your friendship, and it cannot fall to my lot unless you proceed, as you have begun, with the task of developing yourself.


I am already deriving some profit by imagining that we two shall be of one mind, and that whatever portion of my strength has yielded to age will return to me from your strength, although there is not so very much difference in our ages.


when the aim is to make a man learn and not merely to make him wish to learn, we must have recourse to the low-toned words of conversation. They enter more easily, and stick in the memory; for we do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.


Words should be scattered like seed; no matter how small the seed may be, if it has once found favourable ground, it unfolds its strength and from an insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth.


Pick up the list of the philosophers; that very act will compel you to wake up, when you see how many men have been working for your benefit.

Just as the flame springs straight into the air and cannot be cabined or kept down any more than it can repose in quiet, so our soul is always in motion, and the more ardent it is, the greater its motion and activity.


For I do not surrender myself to my affairs, but loan myself to them, and I do not hunt out excuses for wasting my time.


And wherever I am situated, I carry on my own meditations and ponder in my mind some wholesome thought.


When I give myself to my friends, I do not withdraw from my own company, nor do I linger with those who are associated with me through some special occasion or some case which arises from my official position. But I spend my time in the company of all the best; no matter in what lands they may have lived, or in what age, I let my thoughts fly to them.


It is in the power of any man to despise all things, but of no man to possess all things. The shortest cut to riches is to despise riches. Our friend Demetrius, however, lives not merely as if he has learned to despise all things, but as if he has handed them over for others to possess.


I worship the discoveries of wisdom and their discoverers; to enter, as it were, into the inheritance of many predecessors is a delight. It was for me that they laid up this treasure; it was for me that they toiled. But we should play the part of a careful householder; we should increase what we have inherited. This inheritance shall pass from me to my descendants larger than before.


But even if the old masters have discovered everything, one thing will be always new, – the application and the scientific study and classification of the discoveries made by others.


The Stoics believe in one cause only – the maker; but Aristotle thinks that the word "cause" can be used in three ways: "The first cause," he says, "is the actual matter, without which nothing can be created. The second is the workman. The third is the form, which is impressed upon every work, – a statue, for example." This last is what Aristotle calls the idos. "There is, too," says he, "a fourth, – the purpose of the work as a whole."


Plato calls the "ideas," – imperishable, unchangeable, not subject to decay. And therefore, though men die, humanity itself, or the idea of man, according to which man is moulded, lasts on, and though men toil and perish, it suffers no change.


Never shall I lie in order to honour this petty body.


Attalus used to say: "Evil herself drinks the largest portion of her own poison."


primary reason why a man is ungrateful is that he has found it impossible to be grateful enough.


For the soul is made womanish by degrees, and is weakened until it matches the ease and laziness in which it lies.


Much difference is there between lying idle and lying buried!3.


"It was easy for you to challenge evils that were not near-by; but here comes pain, which you declared you could endure; here comes death, against which you uttered many a courageous boast! The whip cracks, the sword flashes: Ah now, Aeneas, thou must needs be stout
And strong of heart!"


This strength of heart, however, will come from constant study, provided that you practise, not with the tongue but with the soul, and provided that you prepare yourself to meet death. To enable yourself to meet death, you may


We speak of a sunny room, even though the same room is pitch-dark at night. 14. It is the day which fills it with light, and the night which steals the light away; thus it is with the things which we call indifferent and "middle," like riches, strength, beauty, titles, kingship, and their opposites, – death, exile, ill-health, pain, and all such evils, the fear of which upsets us to a greater or less extent; it is the wickedness or the virtue that bestows the name of good or evil.


For what good does it do us to guide a horse and control his speed with the curb, and then find that our own passions, utterly uncurbed, bolt with us? Or to beat many opponents in wrestling or boxing, and then to find that we ourselves are beaten by anger?


Posidonius divides the arts into four classes: first we have those which are common and low, then those which serve for amusement, then those which refer to the education of boys, and, finally, the liberal arts.


Food is an aid to the body, but is not a part of it. We get some help from the service which mathematics renders; and mathematics is as indispensable to philosophy as the carpenter is to the mathematician. But carpentering is not a part of mathematics, nor is mathematics a part of philosophy.


best measure of the appetites is not what you want to take, but what you ought to take. 30.


"But," one says, "since you declare that virtue cannot be attained without the 'liberal studies,' how is it that you deny that they offer any assistance to virtue?" Because you cannot attain virtue without food, either; and yet food has nothing to do with virtue. Wood does not offer assistance to a ship, although a ship cannot be built except of wood. There is no reason, I say, why you should think that anything is made by the assistance of that without which it cannot be made. 32.


This desire to know more than is sufficient is a sort of intemperance. 37. Why? Because this unseemly pursuit of the liberal arts makes men troublesome, wordy, tactless, self-satisfied bores, who fail to learn the essentials just because they have learned the non-essentials.


## University of Berkshire Hathaway: 30 Years of Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett &amp; Charlie Munger at the Annual Shareholders Meeting, Daniel Pecaut and Corey Wrenn


Buffett is correct, long–term bonds and other investments vulnerable to inflation should be avoided.


By selling, Buffett is not predicting a decline, though that will surely come someday. He is simply acting on his observation that the intrinsic business values of his holdings are fully reflected in current market prices.


Our goal is more modest: we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.


Munger denied being humble (of course) but noted that the key to his and Buffett’s success has been that “we’ve had a very low opinion of our abilities.” He said that he’d rather be with a guy with an IQ of 130 who thinks it is 128 than a guy with an IQ of 190 who thinks it is 240. The latter will get you into a lot of trouble.


Munger added that the worst mistakes are made from the nicest graphs and what is really needed is “enlightened common sense.”


Or as Keynes said, “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.”


Buffett says the party is over, and the hangover will last longer than the party.


Munger: “Everyone talks about the big money made in real estate, but they forget to talk about the big money lost in real estate.”


Buffett: “You can leverage up to your eyeballs, but you may not make it across the river.”


We’d buy great businesses with excellent management at a fair to bargain price and leave them alone.


whether derivative instruments such as index options should exist at all. Munger’s unhedged opinion, “It’s a totally asinine idea.”


rather than worry about economic projections, these brilliant investors focus on finding good businesses at bargain prices within our resilient economy.


He noted that Golden Arches and The Big Store offer great lessons on business.


As Buffett summed up, “If investors only had to study the past, the richest people would be librarians.”


Ben Franklin’s advice: “Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut thereafter.”

Convolutional neural networks or also known as CNN and are one of the most commonly used types of feed-forward neural networks in that the connectivity pattern between neurons is based on the organization of the common visual cortex system. Therefore, the V1 or the primary visual cortex does edge detection out of raw visual input obtained from the retina. Then, the V2 or secondary visual cortex receives the edge features from the primary visual cortex and extracts simple visual properties such as spatial frequency, orientation, and color.

In spite of Death, the mark and seal of the parental control, Man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine, to criticize, to know, and in imagination to create. To him alone, in the world with which he is acquainted, this freedom belongs; and in this lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his outward life.


Man is a rational animal—so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life, I have looked diligently for evidence in favour of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it, though I have searched in many countries spread over three continents.

If the matter is one that can be settled by observation, make the observation yourself. Aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men by the simple device of asking Mrs Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted. He did not do so because he thought he knew. Thinking that you know when in fact you don’t is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone.

This matter is by no means simple. Suppose I say first ‘A’ and then ‘B’; you may judge: ‘the sound “A” preceded the sound “B” ’. But this implies ‘the sound “A” occurred’ and ‘the sound “B” occurred’, and adds that one occurrence was earlier than the other. Your statement, therefore, is really analogous to such a statement as ‘after I went out I got wet’. It is a molecular statement whose atoms are ‘A occurred’ and ‘B occurred’.

Let us pursue this a little further. I say ‘A’. Then I say ‘what did I say?’ Then you reply ‘you said “A” ’. Now the noise you make when saying ‘A’ in this reply is different from the noise I originally made; therefore, if ‘A’ were the name of a particular noise, your statement would be false. It is only because ‘A’ is the name of a class of noises that your statement is true; your statement classifies the noise I made, just as truly as if you had said ‘you barked like a dog’. This


we cannot define the word ‘word’ without (a) a logical theory of classes, and (b) a psychological understanding of intention. These are difficult matters.


If you ask a boy ‘What is twice two?’ and the boy says ‘four’, you take that as prima facie evidence that the boy knows what twice two is. But if you go on to ask what is twice three, twice four, twice five, and so on, and the boy always answers ‘four’, you come to the conclusion that he knows nothing about it.


good instrument, or a person with much knowledge, will give different responses to stimuli which differ in relevant ways.


We will now assume another boy, who also, when you first question him, asserts that twice two is four. But with this boy, instead of asking him different questions, you make a practice of asking him the same question every day at breakfast. You find that he says five, or six, or seven, or any other number at random, and you conclude that he also does not know what twice two is, though by good luck he answered right the first time.


We do not say the machine knows the answer, because it has no purpose of its own in giving the answer: it does not wish to impress you with its cleverness, or feel proud of being such a good machine. But as far as mere accuracy goes, the machine leaves nothing to be desired.


iron is sensitive to anything magnetic. But sensitiveness does not constitute knowledge, and knowledge of a fact which is not sensible is not sensitiveness to that fact, as we have seen in distinguishing the fact known from the stimulus. As soon as we pass beyond the simple case of question and answer, the definition of knowledge by means of behaviour demands the consideration of purpose. A carrier pigeon flies home, and so we say it ‘knows’ the way.


EDUCATION


The genuine beliefs, though not usually the professed precepts, of parents and teachers are almost unconsciously acquired by most children; and even if they depart from these beliefs in later life, something of them remains deeply implanted, ready to emerge in a time of stress or crisis. Education is, as a rule, the strongest force on the side of what


If the children themselves were considered, education would not aim at making them belong to this party or that, but at enabling them to choose intelligently between the parties; it would aim at making them able to think, not at making them think what their teachers think.


it would aim at making them able to think, not at making them think what their teachers think.


Justice, in the literal sense of equal rights, is obviously not wholly possible as regards children. And as for liberty, it is, to begin with, essentially negative: it condemns all avoidable interference with freedom, without giving a positive principle of construction. But education is essentially constructive, and requires some positive conception of what constitutes a good life.


Authority in education is to some extent unavoidable, and those who educate have to find a way of exercising authority in accordance with the spirit of liberty.


In education, with its codes of rules emanating from a Government office, its large classes and fixed curriculum and overworked teachers, its determination to produce a dead level of glib mediocrity, the lack of reverence for the child is all but universal. Reverence requires imagination and vital warmth; it requires most imagination in respect of those who have least actual achievement or power.


He thinks it is his duty to ‘mould’ the child: in imagination he is the potter with the clay. And so he gives to the child some unnatural shape, which hardens with age, producing strains and spiritual dissatisfactions, out of which grow cruelty and envy, and the belief that others must be compelled to undergo the same distortions.


those who have had most education are very often atrophied in their mental and spiritual life, devoid of impulse, and possessing only certain mechanical aptitudes which take the place of living thought.


Education ought to foster the wish for truth, not the conviction that some particular creed is the truth.


In the long run mental vigour is as essential to success as it is to a good life.


Those who enjoy parallels from ancient history will point to the victory of Sparta over Athens to enforce their moral. But it is Athens that has had power over men’s thoughts and imagination, not Sparta: any one of us, if we could be born again into some past epoch, would rather be born an Athenian than a Spartan. And

Education in credulity leads by quick stages to mental decay; it is only by keeping alive the spirit of free inquiry that the indispensable minimum of progress can be achieved.


Education in credulity leads by quick stages to mental decay; it is only by keeping alive the spirit of free inquiry that the indispensable minimum of progress can be achieved.


Instead of obedience and discipline, we ought to aim at preserving independence and impulse. Instead of ruthlessness, education should try to develop justice in thought. Instead of contempt, it ought to instil reverence, and the attempt at understanding; towards the opinions of others it ought to produce, not necessarily acquiescence, but only such opposition as is combined with imaginative apprehension and a clear realization of the grounds for opposition. Instead of credulity, the object should be to stimulate constructive doubt, the love of mental adventure, the sense of worlds to conquer by enterprise and boldness in thought.


education is treated as a means of acquiring power over the pupil, not as a means of nourishing his own growth.


Obedience and discipline are supposed to be indispensable if order is to be kept in a class, and if any instruction is to be given. To some extent this is true; but the extent is much less than it is thought to be by those who regard obedience and discipline as in themselves desirable.


obedience seem necessary in schools is the large classes and overworked teachers demanded by a false economy. Those who have no experience of teaching are incapable of imagining the expense of spirit entailed by any really living instruction. They think that teachers can reasonably be expected to work as many hours as bank clerks.

The desirable kind of discipline is the kind that comes from within, which consists in the power of pursuing a distant object steadily, forgoing and suffering many things on the way.


The desirable kind of discipline is the kind that comes from within, which consists in the power of pursuing a distant object steadily, forgoing and suffering many things on the way. This involves the subordination of minor impulses to will, the power of a directing action by large creative desires even at moments when they are not vividly alive. Without this, no serious ambition, good or bad, can be realized, no consistent purpose can dominate.

Many things which must be thought about are uninteresting, and even those that are interesting at first often become very wearisome before they have been considered as long as is necessary. The power of giving prolonged attention is very important, and it is hardly to be widely acquired except as a habit induced originally by outside pressure.

Some few boys, it is true, have sufficiently strong intellectual desires to be willing to undergo all that is necessary by their own initiative and free will; but for all others an external inducement is required in order to make them learn any subject thoroughly. There


For the abler boys there is no time for thought, no time for the indulgence of intellectual taste, from the moment of first going to school until the moment of leaving the university. From first to last there is nothing but one long drudgery of examination tips and textbook facts. The most intelligent, at the end, are disgusted with learning, longing only to forget it and to escape into a life of action. Yet there, as before, the economic machine holds them prisoners, and all their spontaneous desires are bruised and thwarted.


Passive acceptance of the teacher’s wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man.


Passive acceptance of the teacher’s wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes men to seek a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position. It makes the power of Churches, Governments, party caucuses, and all the other organizations by which plain men are misled into supporting old systems which are harmful to the nation and to themselves.


If the object were to make pupils think, rather than to make them accept certain conclusions, education would be conducted quite differently: there would be less rapidity of instruction and more discussion, more occasions when pupils are encouraged to express themselves, more attempt to make education


The joy of mental adventure is far commoner in the young than in grown men and women. Among children it is very common, and grows naturally out of the period of make-believe and fancy. It is rare in later life because everything is done to kill it during education.


Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth—more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. It sees man, a feeble speck, surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence; yet it bears itself proudly, as unmoved as if it were lord of the universe. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.


‘Should the working man think freely about property? Then what will become of us, the rich? Should young men and young women think freely about sex? Then what will become of morality? Should soldiers think freely about war? Then what will become of military discipline? Away with thought! Back into the shades of prejudice, lest property, morals, and war should be endangered! Better men should be stupid, slothful, and oppressive than that their thoughts should be free. For if their thoughts were free they might not think as we do. And at all costs this disaster must be averted.’


It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it so seldom achieves a great result. The wish to preserve the past rather than the hope of creating the future dominates the minds of those who control the teaching of the young.


In education, their crime was that they were not actuated by love of their pupils, but by ulterior ends.


The modern world needs a different type, with more imaginative sympathy, more intellectual suppleness, less belief in bull-dog courage and more belief in technical knowledge.


The intellectual level in Western Europe and the artistic level in Eastern Europe are, on the whole, higher than in America.


What a man is as an end perishes when he dies; what he produces as a means continues to the end of time.

Human beings are prone to become absorbed in themselves, unable to be interested in what they see and hear or in anything outside their own skins. This is a great misfortune to themselves, since it entails at best boredom and at worst melancholia; it is also a fatal barrier to usefulness, except in very exceptional cases. Vitality promotes interest in the outside world; it also promotes the power of hard work. Moreover, it is a safeguard

Probably the whole of Newton’s controversy with Leibniz, which ruined English mathematics for over a hundred years, would have been avoided if Newton had been robust and able to enjoy ordinary pleasures. In spite of its limitations, therefore, I reckon vitality among the qualities which it is important that all men should possess.


Timidity in mothers or nurses is very quickly imitated by children through suggestion. Hitherto, men have thought it attractive in women to be full of irrational terrors, because it gave men a chance to seem protective without incurring any real danger. But the sons of these men have acquired the terrors from their mothers, and have had to be afterwards trained to regain a courage which they need never have lost if their fathers had not desired to despise their mothers. The harm that has been done by the subjection of women is incalculable; this matter of fear affords only one incidental

From the point of view of psychology and physiology, fear and rage are closely analogous emotions; the man who feels rage is not possessed of the highest kind of courage.


To begin with self-respect: some men live from within, while others are mere mirrors of what is felt and said by their neighbours. The latter can never have true courage: they must have admiration, and are haunted by the fear of losing it. The teaching of ‘humility’, which used to be thought desirable, was the means of producing a perverted form of this same vice. ‘Humility’ suppressed self-respect, but not the desire for the respect of others; it merely made nominal self-abasement the means of acquiring credit. Thus it produced hypocrisy and falsification of instinct.


only those who have learned to obey know how to command. What I suggest is that no one should learn how to obey, and no one should attempt to command. I


Our purposes should be our own, not the result of external authority; and our purposes should never be forcibly imposed upon others.


The man whose hopes and fears are all centred upon himself can hardly view death with equanimity, since it extinguishes his whole emotional universe.


For this reason, paradoxical as it may seem, a man of wide and vivid interests finds less difficulty in leaving life than is experienced by some miserable hypochondriac whose interests are bounded by his own ailments. Thus the perfection of courage is found in the man of many interests, who feels his ego to be but a small part of the world, not through despising himself, but through valuing much that is not himself.


Cognitive sensitiveness, which should also be included, is practically the same thing as a habit of observation, and this is more naturally considered in connection with intelligence.


Church led men to think that nothing matters except virtue, and virtue consists in abstinence from a certain list of actions arbitrarily labelled ‘sin’. So long as this attitude persists, it is impossible to make men realize that intelligence does more good than an artificial conventional ‘virtue’.


The more a man has learnt, the easier it is for him to learn still more—always assuming that he has not been taught in a spirit of dogmatism. Ignorant people have never been compelled to change their mental habits, and have stiffened into an unchangeable attitude.


I regard the cultivation of intelligence, therefore, as one of the major purposes of education. This might seem a commonplace, but in fact it is not. The


The widespread interest in gossip is inspired, not by a love of knowledge, but by malice: no one gossips about other people’s secret virtues, but only about their secret vices. Accordingly most gossip is untrue, but care is taken not to verify it.


Animals, machines, thunderstorms, and all forms of manual work, arouse the curiosity of children, whose thirst for knowledge puts the most intelligent adult to shame. This impulse grows weaker with advancing years until at last what is unfamiliar inspires only disgust, with no desire for a closer acquaintance. This is the stage at which people announce that the country is going to the dogs, and that ‘things are not what they were in my young days’. The thing which is not the same as it was in that far-off time is the speaker’s curiosity. And with the death of curiosity we may reckon that active intelligence, also, has died.


(A timid person would rather remain miserable than do anything unusual.)


A man is called sane when he is as sane as the average of his contemporaries; but in the average man many of the mechanisms which determine his opinions and actions are quite fantastic, so much so that in a world of real sanity they would be called insane.


THE FUNCTIONS OF A TEACHER


Any man who has the genuine impulse of the teacher will be more anxious to survive in his books than in the flesh.


Institutions such as universities largely remained in the grip of the dogmatists, with the result that most of the best intellectual work was done by independent men of learning. In England, especially, until near the end of the nineteenth century, hardly any men of first-rate eminence except Newton were connected with universities.


One hears it said over and over again that democracy weakens a country in war, in spite of the fact that in every important war since the year 1700 the victory has gone to the more democratic side.


So far as knowledge is concerned, a man should be aware of the minuteness of himself and his immediate environment in relation to the world in time and space.


He should see his own age in relation to the past and the future, and be aware that its own controversies will seem as strange to future ages as those of the past seem to us now.


Christianity, like all religions except Mormonism, is Asiatic in origin; it had in the early centuries that emphasis on individualism and other-worldliness which is characteristic of Asiatic mysticism.


The finest minds will always be attracted to ultimate questions that remain unsolved. Lesser minds are content with ‘answers’ to questions for which there is no evidence.


It is the quality of infinity that makes religion, the selfless, untrammelled life in the whole which frees men from the prison house of eager wishes and little thoughts. This liberation from the prison is given by religion, but only by a religion without fettering dogmas; and dogmas become fettering as soon as assent to them becomes unnatural.

## A Timeless Spring: Krishnamurti at Rajghat, Krishnamurti


So it is one of our problems, whether we be educators or parents, to see that this inward excellence, innocence and vitality, which is destroyed through fear, through anxiety, greed and ambition, is never destroyed.


whether the other is sorry to leave or not has very little meaning, because it is your life, and you have to live it. It is you who have to face all the struggles, the miseries, and the joys. And to help you come out of it all, innocent, simple, and with a clear mind, is the function of education.


To navigate the vast, uncharted ocean of life demands an extraordinary capacity to meet its many hazards but, unfortunately, you are not educated for that; you are not told anything about it.


But when at last you meet the sea of life, the battle begins: there are fears, anxieties, despairs; there is deep questioning. Life becomes, for you, a terribly complex problem, a problem for which you want a very simple answer.


pursue some other philosophy or ideal in the hope of having a simple answer to everything. But there is no simple answer along any particular line.


Life is a most complex affair which most people do not understand and, being disturbed, they seek what they call God.


All that we know is what we have learnt from books. We merely repeat what we have read in the Gita, the Quran or the Bible and, thereby, think that we have solved our problems. We must be educated to go beyond the trained monkey, beyond the programmed machine, beyond the repetitive process which we call modern existence.


All that we know is what we have learnt from books. We merely repeat what we have read in the Gita, the Quran or the Bible and, thereby, think that we have solved our problems. We must be educated to go beyond the trained monkey, beyond the programmed machine, beyond the repetitive process which we call modern existence. To go beyond the repetitive process demands a brain that is extraordinarily alert, perceptive; and, surely, it is the function of education to bring about such a brain, rather than a brain which mechanically records and repeats what it has read in a book or heard the teacher say.


Everything around you is pouring its influence into you, and the first thing is to be aware of this, to become conscious of it, and not ask how one is to get rid of it.


Freedom from all influence is really the essence of an enlightened mind, because the enlightened mind is a light unto itself, and does not depend upon another.


How do you get the energy just to move from here to your room?—by eating, sleeping, being in good health, and also by having the desire to move from here to there. You also move when it is profitable to do so, or when there is fear, or when there is any other form of urgency.


How do you get the energy just to move from here to your room?—by eating, sleeping, being in good health, and also by having the desire to move from here to there. You also move when it is profitable to do so, or when there is fear, or when there is any other form of urgency. Similarly, when you really want to find out what is true, and you see the necessity of breaking through all influences, you will have the energy to do it. Energy comes with urgency. When the house is on fire, you have to do something about it at once, don’t you? It is no good picking up a book to see what it says about putting out a fire. The burning house demands that you act, and the very urgency of that demand gives you the energy to act. Similarly, when you realize the urgency of living without being influenced, and the urgency of doing something about the corruption and the rottenness that exist in this world, then you will have the energy to do it. Your life is a series of challenges which are constantly demanding immediate action and, when you face these challenges all the time, you will always have the required energy to meet them.  


But most of us have become dull. We have no real sense of urgency because we refuse to face the challenge of life. The challenge is there under our noses, it is not just for the few; any man can pick it up.


I don’t know if you have ever wondered why we imitate, copy, follow, obey, and fashion our thoughts after what somebody or the other has said. Life is extraordinarily swift and vital, but we reduce it to a few fixed patterns and live within those patterns.


The moment you accept authority, you are setting up a pattern, a framework within which your


Most people in the world—the old as well as the young—have this extraordinary sense of fear. There is the normal biological instinct to protect oneself, which makes one stay away from a venomous snake, and so on, but I am not talking about that. I am talking about the fears which are psychological, the fears which are under the skin.


A fearful mind imitates, accepts and obeys, which means that it will cease to function freely. A fearful mind is incapable of living completely, wholly, with an intensity of its own.


To be free of fear, you must first know that you are frightened. And, secondly, you must not run away from it; you must not escape from fear, but look at it.


In the same way, watch every fear that arises within you. Whether it is fear of a snake, fear of your parents, fear of an older boy, fear of your teacher, or fear in any other form, do not run away from it, but observe it, question it, find out what that


In the same way, watch every fear that arises within you. Whether it is fear of a snake, fear of your parents, fear of an older boy, fear of your teacher, or fear in any other form, do not run away from it, but observe it, question it, find out what that fear is. Watch your fear, and learn from it.


talking—you must not only question what you hear, but also observe your response to what you hear so that your mind will not be clouded by fear or prejudice and, therefore, will become sharp, clear, precise, reasonable, healthy.


But to have freedom is one of the most difficult things on earth. It means being free from fear, from ambition, from greed, from envy.


To love a child means seeing that he or she gets the right kind of education. To love a child means seeing that he or she is not made into a machine which merely repeats ideas learnt from a book, but is


To love a child means seeing that he or she gets the right kind of education. To love a child means seeing that he or she is not made into a machine which merely repeats ideas learnt from a book, but is helped to be intelligent.


They may have a lot of property, they may call themselves by big names but, inside, they have nothing, because they do not know how to see. I really mean this.


Just watch everything in life. Watching is a most extraordinary thing. Out of watching comes intelligence. If you know how to watch, you will not have to read all the complicated books on philosophy or religion. If you know how to look, how to listen, and how to speak, you will realize that it is all there in your own eyes, your own ears, and on your own tongue.


Look at your parents and teachers; notice how they talk to you, what kind of words they use. Do not criticize them, because nobody likes being criticized. Just watch them very objectively, without criticizing, without judging. If you can do this, they will know that you are watching and, as this watching has a big effect on people, they will begin to be a little more alert, a little less careless and untidy. It will also have a big effect on you. If you can observe and listen all the time during the whole day, you will find that both your body and your mind become very sensitive and, therefore, naturally disciplined. Discipline and sensitivity go together.


Then you will also find that you can live happily in this mad, stupid world with a few essential things, being neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, but tremendously alive; and from that will come the discovery of something much greater, something far beyond all this wanting and not-wanting.


France, Italy, Germany, China, and so on, and all these countries go on fighting each other, is that not a mad and stupid way to be? The earth is ours, yours and mine, and we have to live on it


France, Italy, Germany, China, and so on, and all these countries go on fighting each other, is that not a mad and stupid way to be? The earth is ours, yours and mine, and we have to live on it together; we have to cherish it and grow things in its soil, so that all the people in the world will have sufficient food, clothing and shelter.


What matters is what you are. What matters is how you live, what your feelings are—not at the particular moment when you go to a temple, or when you look at a picture which you consider God, but every day.


But outside this place there is a storm going on, a terrific storm of change. And, as you grow up, you will be thrown into that storm, and you will not know what to do. Therefore, you will carve out a little space for yourself, for your little family, and live there, rotting, quarrelling, bitter, unhappy, wanting more children, more money, more this and more that—and that will be all.


because it breeds wars, it breeds divisions, it breeds antagonism,


What is right?


You and I are both going to learn from your question. I am not going to instruct you, and you are not going to follow me. In discussing, both of us are going to learn. Do not control the mind when it wanders. I will tell you why. The mind wanders because it has innumerable interests. If you control the mind so as to concentrate on any one thing, you will build a resistance to all other things. That is not understanding. To understand, you have to explore every thought to its end. For example, if you think about a friend when you want to do something else, go into it and find out why you think about that friend; find out what the motives are. When other thoughts come, just ask these thoughts to wait while you go into the first thought. Your interest in finding out why the thought about your friend arose will bring about a quality of perception nor only with regard to that thought, but also with regard to all the other thoughts.


What happens, in the case of most of you, is that when there is an unpleasant thought, you say, ‘This is a terrible thought, so I must concentrate on the other thoughts’. This does not lead to the understanding of that thought. To understand that thought, you have to investigate it even though you consider it terrible. And, unless the mind is extraordinarily alert, it is very arduous to go into each thought, to enquire into and learn about it.


It is inward brutality to conform, to imitate, to be angry, jealous, ambitious, greedy. You can be free of this brutality only when you are fully aware of it all the time, and that requires a sharp, clear, precise and passionate mind.

## The Great Mental Models: General Thinking Concepts, Shane Parrish


You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don’t know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know.


When understanding is separated from reality, we lose our powers. Understanding must constantly be tested against reality and updated accordingly. This isn’t a box we can tick, a task with a definite beginning and end, but a continuous process.


There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”


Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions.


The further we are from the results of our decisions, the easier it is to keep our current views rather than update them. When you put your hand on a hot stove, you quickly learn the natural consequence. You pay the price for your mistakes. Since you are a pain-avoiding creature, you update your view. Before you touch another stove, you check to see if it’s hot. But you don’t just learn a micro lesson that applies in one situation.


Confucius said, “A man who has committed a mistake and doesn’t correct it, is committing another mistake.”


When it comes to seeing what is—that is, understanding reality—we can follow Charles Darwin’s advice to notice things “which easily escape attention,” and ask why things happened.


It may seem counterintuitive, to work on developing knowledge that is available to everyone, but the universe works in the same way no matter where you are in it. What you need is to understand the principles, so that when the details change you are still able to identify what is really going on.


We are afraid to learn and admit when we don’t know enough. This is the mindset that leads to poor decisions.


When things happen in accord with our view of the world we naturally think they are good for us and others. When they conflict with our views, they are wrong and bad. But the world is smarter than we are and it will teach us all we need to know if we’re open to its feedback—if we keep our feet on the ground.


“To the man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail.”


the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. The abstraction is not the abstracted.


«Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.»


As more and more people know what model you’re using to manipulate them, they may decide not to respond to your incentives. As your competitors gain knowledge of the model, they respond in kind by adopting the model themselves, thus flattening the field.


When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes.

Socratic questioning generally follows this process: Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)

thought experiments are tremendously useful. Imagining physical impossibilities Re-imagining history Intuiting the non-intuitive


Thought experiments tell you about the limits of what you know and the limits of what you should attempt. In order to improve our decision-making and increase our chances of success, we must be willing to probe all of the possibilities we can think of. Thought experiments are not daydreams. They require both rigor and work. But the more you use them, the more you understand actual cause and effect, and the more knowledge you have of what can really be accomplished.


In 1963, the UC Santa Barbara ecologist and economist Garrett Hardin proposed his First Law of Ecology: “You can never merely do one thing.”3 We operate in a world of multiple, overlapping connections, like a web, with many significant, yet obscure and unpredictable, relationships. He developed second-order thinking into a tool, showing that if you don’t consider “the effects of the effects,” you can’t really claim to be doing any thinking at all.


«When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.»

Second-order thinking involves asking ourselves if what we are doing now is going to get us the results we want.


The core of Bayesian thinking (or Bayesian updating, as it can be called) is this: given that we have limited but useful information about the world, and are constantly encountering new information, we should probably take into account what we already know when we learn something new. As much of it as possible. Bayesian thinking allows us to use all relevant prior information in making decisions. Statisticians might call it a base rate, taking in outside information about past situations like the one you’re in.

When you look at the intervening years, the climb in diabetes diagnosis is steady, not a spike. So the prior relevant data, or priors, indicate a trend that is worrisome. It is important to remember that priors themselves are probability estimates. For each bit of prior knowledge, you are not putting it in a binary structure, saying it is true or not. You’re assigning it a probability of being true. Therefore, you can’t let your priors get in the way of processing new knowledge. In Bayesian terms, this is called the likelihood ratio or the Bayes factor. Any new information you encounter

In Bayesian terms, this is called the likelihood ratio or the Bayes factor. Any new information you encounter that challenges a prior simply means that the probability of that prior being true may be reduced. Eventually some priors are replaced completely. This is an ongoing cycle of challenging and validating what you believe you know. When making uncertain decisions, it’s nearly always a mistake not to ask: What are the relevant priors? What might I already know that I can use to better understand the reality of the situation?


Conditional probability is similar to Bayesian thinking in practice, but comes at it from a different angle. When you use historical events to predict the future, you have to be mindful of the conditions that surrounded that event. Events can be independent, like tossing a coin, or dependent. In


Fat-tailed curves are different. Take a look. At first glance they seem similar enough. Common outcomes cluster together, creating a wave. The difference is in the tails. In a bell curve the extremes are predictable. There can only be so much deviation from the mean. In a fat-tailed curve there is no real cap on extreme events.


The more extreme events that are possible, the longer the tails of the curve get. Any one extreme event is still unlikely, but the sheer number of options means that we can’t rely on the most common outcomes as representing the average. The more extreme events that are possible, the higher the probability that one of them will occur. Crazy things are definitely going to happen, and we have no way of identifying when.


In a bell curve type of situation, like displaying the distribution of height or weight in a human population, there are outliers on the spectrum of possibility, but the outliers have a fairly well-defined scope. You’ll never meet a man who is ten times the size of an average man.


In a bell curve type of situation, like displaying the distribution of height or weight in a human population, there are outliers on the spectrum of possibility, but the outliers have a fairly well-defined scope. You’ll never meet a man who is ten times the size of an average man. But in a curve with fat tails, like wealth, the central tendency does not work the same way. You may regularly meet people who are ten, 100, or 10,000 times wealthier than the average person.


Asymmetries: Finally, you need to think about something we might call “metaprobability”—the probability that your probability estimates themselves are any good.


In The Black Swan, he argues that any small error in measuring the risk of an extreme event can mean we’re not just slightly off, but way off—off by orders of magnitude, in


We can think about three categories of objects: Ones that are harmed by volatility and unpredictability, ones that are neutral to volatility and unpredictability, and finally, ones that benefit from it. The latter category is antifragile—like a package that wants to be mishandled.


There are two ways to handle such a world: try to predict, or try to prepare. Prediction is tempting. For all of human history, seers and soothsayers have turned a comfortable trade. The problem is that nearly all studies of “expert” predictions in such complex real-world realms as the stock market, geopolitics, and global finance have proven again and again that, for the rare and impactful events in our world, predicting is impossible! It’s more efficient to prepare.


how to fail properly. Failing properly has two major components. First, never take a risk that will do you in completely. (Never get taken out of the game completely.) Second, develop the personal resilience to learn from your failures and start again. With these two rules, you can only fail temporarily.


No one likes to fail. It hurts. But failure carries with it one huge antifragile gift: learning. Those who are not afraid to fail (properly) have a huge advantage over the rest. What they learn makes them less vulnerable to the volatility of the world. They benefit from it, in true antifragile fashion.

Often we focus on positive goals, such as “I want to be rich,” and use this to guide our approach. We make investing and career choices based on our desire to accumulate wealth. We chase after magical solutions, like attempting to outsmart the stock market. These inevitably get us nowhere, and we have usually taken some terrible risks in the process which actually leave us worse off.


Instead, we can try inverting the goal. It becomes, not getting rich, but avoiding being poor. Instead of trying to divine the decisions that will bring wealth, we first try to eliminate those behaviors that are guaranteed to erode it.

The result: a human face mask, worn on the back of head. Remarkably, no one wearing a mask was attacked by a tiger for the next three years; anyone killed by tigers during that time had either refused to wear the mask, or had taken it off while working.

It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one word which denotes a universal. The nearest approach would be some such statement as 'I like this'.

Thus all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals.

## The Concept of Emotion in Classical Indian Philosophy, Joerg Tuske


The reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to rational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling. The fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to some views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According to these views, rational thought, which is representational and therefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from the feelings.

While this is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a justified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different positions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as is the case with regard to Western philosophy. This article introduces some of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation to cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article roughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in classical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have paid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would classify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist account of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the other accounts. 1.

Conclusion Bibliography ◦  Primary sources ◦  Secondary sources Academic Tools Other Internet Resources Related Entries   1. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account of the emotions The discussion of this account will focus on the Nyāya-sūtras, Vātsyāyana's Nyāya-bhāṣya, Uddyotakara's Nyāya-vārttika and Jayanta Bhaṭṭa's Nyāya-mañjarī. In addition, the Vaiśeṣika-sūtras together with Śaṅkara Miśra's Vaiśeṣika-sūtra-upaskāra will be mentioned. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account of the emotions involves a strict division into cognition (jñāna) and mental phenomena that include a feeling aspect, such as love or attraction (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa). One of the main reasons for this is the acceptance of the existence of a permanent immaterial self (ātman) by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. According to their arguments, the ātman is a substance (dravya) which possesses several qualities (guṇas), such as cognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain. This enumeration shows that there is no common


According to their arguments, the ātman is a substance (dravya) which possesses several qualities (guṇas), such as cognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain.


The important aspect of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account is that the individual emotions, such as attachment and aversion are regarded as defects (doṣas) [NB 1.1.18] or impurities (upadhā) [VS and VSU 6.2.4]. These defects are the result of ignorance (mithyājñāna) and they give rise to actions that lead to the feeling of pleasure or pain.


The desire for eternal pleasure, however, is not detrimental to liberation; in fact it is a precondition for liberation.


cognition has a special status among the qualities of self: no other quality can be experienced without cognition.


The defects fall into 3 groups: i) attraction (rāga), ii) aversion (dveṣa) and iii) illusion (moha) [NS 4.1.3].


Even love, which is regarded as a positive emotion in many cultures, is ultimately a defect because all emotions lead to attachment and error.


For the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, pleasure and pain are not forms of cognition because they have different causes than cognitions [VS and VSU 10.1.5–6]. This means that we can have a cognition without a feeling and we can also have a feeling without a cognition.


The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika view shows similarities with the received view of the emotions in Western philosophy with regard to the point that feelings are a disturbance of cognition. However, in many Western accounts cognition is regarded as an end in itself because it coincides with the ideal of rational thinking, whereas according to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers cognition is not an end in itself. Rather, it is supposed to lead to the conclusion that final liberation is the ultimate aim and final liberation means the end of cognition.


By definition, any purely cognitive state of mind presupposes the existence of a mind or intellect. For Śaṃkara, however, the problem is that a mind will always have certain qualities that would be called emotive in Western philosophy, such as desire, aversion, hatred, pleasure or pain. So, as long there are cognitions, there will also be emotions. Therefore, both must be eliminated in order for the self to attain liberation. On this point, Śaṃkara agrees with the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. While Śaṃkara distinguishes between emotions and cognitions, his distinction is not as pronounced as that of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. He regards both as qualities of the mind or intellect.

Unlike the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Vedānta accounts of the emotions, the Sāṃkhya-Yoga account does not draw a fundamental distinction between feelings and cognitions. The reason for this is that the Sāṃkhya account rests on the division between puruṣa and prakṛti. The former is pure consciousness and does not contain any cognitions or feelings whereas prakṛti is primordial matter and has the three qualities (guṇas) sattva, rajas and tamas, which are aligned with different feelings: sattva with pleasure (sukha), rajas with pain (duḥkha) and tamas with confusion or illusion (moha).


## Cosmological Koans: A Journey to the Heart of Physical Reality, Anthony Aguirre


With effortless focus, Munenori Sensei smoothly pulls the arrow to bend his bow. Released like a ripe fruit, the arrow glides. It races toward your heart. In the eternity of the arrow’s flight, you wonder: What is this present moment? Confronting its end, your mind becomes razor sharp, cleaving time into uncountable, quickly passing moments. At one such perfect instant you see the arrow as it floats, suspended between the finest ticks of the most precise clock. In this instant of no time, the arrow has no motion, and nothing pushes or pulls it toward your heart. How, then, does it move? While your beginner’s mind embraces the mystery, the arrow flies.


Newton and Leibniz, crucially, tackled the question of what happens when the time interval* Δt approaches zero—precisely the domain of Zeno’s paradox. What they were able to show is that, as you would expect, during this infinitesimal time interval, the distance interval Δd vanishes just like Δt does. Yet in a well-defined and mathematically precise way, the ratio Δd/Δt—the speed—nonetheless takes on a particular finite and nonzero value. This mathematical method, which forms the roots of differential calculus, gives a response to Zeno’s paradox. It says that you must not go all the way to the limit of zero duration without also going at the same time to the limit of zero distance interval—and if you do this correctly, the speed of the arrow never goes to zero. No matter how short the duration, the arrow is never at rest. There is no such thing as an instant of time during which the arrow does not move at all, so the premise of Zeno’s paradox, as well as the necessity of thinking about “atoms of time,” is neatly avoided.


How, at some instant of time, does the arrow “know” which way to go? At that instant, it has a position, but its velocity depends on where it was a moment ago. Does the arrow “remember” where it was? Or does it carry its velocity as some intrinsic property, like its color? Why does the arrow have inertia that keeps it going in the same direction as its velocity, yet changes in just the right way for the arrow to perfectly trace out a preordained path?


In a very real sense, we are speeding through the universe, right now, at about Mach 1,000—the sort of speed that could whisk someone to anywhere on Earth in less than a minute. Do you feel it?


Mach 1,000—the sort of speed that could whisk


How do objects know how to resist change in something so ephemeral? Does an object somehow “sense” all the other objects around it, so as to know how it is moving relative to them, and resist change to this motion? How does this make sense? What is this thing called inertia?


“So I’m drifting through the years. Moving in time. Steadily. But how do I feel that motion, when I could not feel the ship? If motion is meaningless, is the flow of time also empty?”


As Einstein is said to have joked: “When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it’s only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it’s two hours.”6 From this perspective, the phrase “moving through time” seems to make a bit more sense: time is laid out, like space, and as our internal sense of time ticks away, we experience both different places and different clock times. In this way, we move through space and time, both of which exist, all laid out, quite independent of us moving through them.


Time runs differently into the future and into the past.


The challenge that Zenjo whispers is a difficult one: Is time everything, or is it nothing?


(acceleration) = (gravitational field) × (gravitational charge) / (inertia). This tells us the acceleration of any object, given the gravitational field, along with two properties intrinsic to the object: its response to a gravitational field (gravitational charge) and its resistance to acceleration (inertia).


Galileo’s experiment and its successors show us that insofar as we can eliminate other nongravitational forces, all objects accelerate at precisely the same rate in a given gravitational field. For this to be true, gravitational charge and inertia must be the same thing! In other words, the extra difficulty in moving the iron ball is exactly, precisely, perfectly9 compensated by the extra force exerted on it by the Earth! This is not true of magnetism or any other force.

This is not true of magnetism or any other force. THIS AMAZING FACT sat essentially idle for 300 years, until Albert Einstein showed that there is a deep explanation for it, which requires a radically new way of thinking about space and time. Recall from the flight of THE ARROW that, absent any forces, objects move in a straight line, at a constant speed. Another way to say this is that in the absence of any forces, the path of an object is a straight line in space and time. To see this, let’s plot the balls’ trajectories just as we did for the arrow. As long as the ball rolls at a constant speed and direction, the path through space and time is straight. But if the ball speeds up—for example, because we have placed a magnet in front of it—it covers more and more distance through space for a given distance in time, and the path becomes curved; the wooden ball’s path, unaffected by the magnetic force, remains straight (see the figure below, top left panel). We could also imagine the balls being blown by a strong wind. In this case, all three experience the same force, but the wooden ball, having the least inertia, is affected the most; the lead ball is accelerated least (top right panel). For gravity, the Earth pulls on all three balls to accelerate them. The difference, as Galileo discovered, is that all three paths curve in exactly the same way (bottom panel).


The gravitational acceleration of an object has no connection whatsoever to what the object actually is; it depends only on the object’s environment. We might dismiss this as a strange curiosity. But to Einstein it was a crucial clue to the true nature of gravity. On the basis of this clue, Einstein declared that gravity is not a force at all.


mapmaking is telling us something crucial about the territory mapped: not just the locations of the objects, but the curvature of the substratum—the Earth—itself. The inability to map a surface with a single fixed scale onto a flat sheet tells us that the surface is curved. It took


So we understand how to take our journey one step at a time to get its true measure.


But imagine yourself in the thunderstorm that is happening somewhere on Earth at this moment. You notice that a flash of lightning and the accompanying thunder happen at different times by your internal clock. The interpretation is simple: the thunder is a sound wave traveling at the speed of sound and takes some time to reach you; the flash, traveling at the vastly faster speed of light, takes an imperceptible amount of time.


there is a complex relationship, and there can be an enormous difference, between what is happening right now and what we are observing right now. This does not feel terribly troubling, but it is a good reason to be very cautious.


Einstein’s formula using actual quantities, if your friend goes for a 10-minute walk (by her watch) while you stay in one place, then because she is moving while you are staying still, 10 minutes plus 3 femtoseconds will have passed for you when she returns.


Einstein’s formula using actual quantities, if your friend goes for a 10-minute walk (by her watch) while you stay in one place, then because she is moving while you are staying still, 10 minutes plus 3 femtoseconds will have passed for you when she returns. The effect is incredibly, undetectably tiny in real life as opposed to the gondola dream, because light travels at 300,000 kilometers (not 2 meters) per second. You could live thousands of years and never, ever notice it in your everyday life. But there it lurks: a fundamental difference between the way you think the world works, and the way it actually does. And make no mistake, it is real and well tested: for example, each satellite in the global positioning system (GPS) carries an extremely precise atomic clock. The rate of time passage on these satellites is verifiably different from the rate on Earth. In fact, this and other relativistic effects must be treated carefully in order for GPS to function at all; failure to account for them would lead to errors of tens of kilometers per day in your location!


The universal now is a fiction.


Lagrange formulated a beautiful set of equations that connect the Lagrangian (our L, not coincidentally) to the force felt by a particle traveling between two space-time events.


According to an observer watching from atop the cliff, the book appears to have a curved path, as do you. But the book travels in a straight line relative to you, who have jumped off with it. So who is right? Is it a straight line or not? This is quite reminiscent of the question of distance, or duration, between different events: each observer has a unique description, connected with that person’s own reference frame, and all are equally valid.


These paths have a particular property: just as a straight line in space is the shortest distance between two positions, the path that objects follow through space-time is the longest path between two events, if we measure the space-time length between the events by the “heartbeat time” experienced by someone following that path between the two events. Finally, forces can then be considered as any effects that cause objects to deviate from this natural path through space-time.


But as Einstein discovered, the fact that light travels at the same speed in any inertial frame requires Galileo’s rule to be modified into a different rule. This modified rule distorts space and time intervals, so that two events separated by some amount of time in one inertial frame are separated by a different amount of time in another frame.

When someone gives you something, an opinion, a report, an article, a plan, consider how it is framed. Who is involved in this information, and what do you know about their vantage point? Knowing the factors that influence how a person frames issues helps you understand their perspective and how you can use it to augment your own.


What matters is understanding the complexity and value of multiple perspectives. No one sees it all. Multiple perspectives layered together reduce blind spots and offer us a more textured and truer sense of the underlying reality.

Reciprocation teaches us that if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all, you are likely to receive the same. But if you give people opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior.


The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or changed from one form to another, such as from light to heat. The first law is known as the law of conservation of energy and it deals with the transfer of energy. There are two forms of energy exchange—heat and work. Heat is energy exchange through thermal interaction and work is energy exchange by any process other than heat. Whereas work can be completely converted into heat, heat cannot be completely converted to work.


The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy (a measure of disorder simply understood as energy unable to be used to do work) of an isolated system always increases. Isolated systems are those that spontaneously progress toward the state of maximum entropy of the system, also described as thermal equilibrium—no net heat flow between objects. The entropy of the universe only increases with time. One of the impacts of this law is that we need to expend energy to create order. Without the deployment of energy, all things move away from order.


The third law of thermodynamics states that as temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a given system approaches a constant value.


The fourth law of thermodynamics is known as the zeroth law. This is because it was formulated after the first three laws but is fundamental to and assumed by the others. It states that if two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, then those two objects are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.


So they built a wall. And not just any wall—one with multiple layers of complexity and deterrents. In addition to the structure above ground, subway tunnels, sewers, and anything that could give passage to the west was sealed off or modified so that human passage was thwarted. The Berlin Wall never worked completely.


To keep two substances in direct contact from adjusting to the same temperature is difficult. It requires an insulator and preventing any temperature change in the two substances is only possible with a constant investment of energy. The concept of equilibrium is a useful lens to understanding the inevitable fall of physical walls that humans have built around the globe. It is difficult to prevent two cultures in direct contact from sharing ideas and customs.


A simple example of entropy is to consider life itself. There is a constant effort to maintain structure (avoid entropy) by consuming external energy (sunlight, food). In the process, life increases the entropy of (destroys) its environment and decreases entropy (builds or repairs) the organism’s body.


The inertia of belief can make it difficult to cause real change in the world. But that same inertia can help those who are determined to cause change to hold onto their beliefs and push through.


Lise Meitner was nominated 29 times for the Nobel Prize, including three times by Niels Bohr, but was never awarded the honor. 20  21 We do not have to look hard to find beliefs with incredible inertia that Meitner had to fight against.


Everything that moves has to move through something, including information. Why does some information get disseminated quickly, whereas other times it gets bogged down and seems to go nowhere? The answer often has a lot less to do with the content of the information than with the environment it has to move through. To understand just how much a communications environment can be manipulated to affect the pace of information exchange, let’s take a look at Soviet Russia.


It’s all fine and nice to put out messages of where a company wants to go, but it needs to make sure that the environment doesn’t have such high friction that everyone feels like they are trying to move a cement wall in order to get there.


Speed is just movement; even if you are running in place, you have speed. Velocity has direction. You must go somewhere in order to have velocity. This model teaches us that it’s much more important to pay attention to where you are going and not how fast you are moving.


While speed ensures movement, velocity produces a result.


Something has a constant velocity if it is moving at a consistent speed in a straight line without changing direction.


The kinetic energy of an object is relative to what the other objects are doing in the environment. The ball will have more kinetic energy relative to your friend sitting in a lawn chair watching you throw it but will have almost none relative to the dog that is chasing after it. Potential energy, on the other hand, is completely independent of the movement of other objects in the environment.


We want to move somewhere so we can look back and identify the territory we’ve covered. This is why having a direction is so important: it lets us evaluate the usefulness of what we are doing by giving us a measurement of where we want to go.

Notes: 1) And thaa is why velocity not speed is what one should look for.

In chemistry, activation energy is the energy that must be delivered to a chemical system in order to initiate a reaction, breaking bonds so that new ones can form. Molecules must collide to react, and movement speeds up when temperature increases.


Double the atmospheric CO2 levels and temperatures rise by 5–6°C, probably more like 2–3°C per modern estimates.


One of the most important aspects of activation energy is that you need enough of it to power a reaction through to its conclusion.


One of the most important aspects of activation energy is that you need enough of it to power a reaction through to its conclusion. We all know that one sheet of newspaper won’t start a fire in our fireplace.


Creating lasting change is harder than creating change. Don’t underestimate the activation energy required to not only break apart existing bonds, but to create new, strong ones. Some reactions are not quick, and all take some degree of effort. Trying to accurately estimate the activation energy required means you’re less likely to quit too early.


The mechanisms through which catalysts work are relatively simple in theory. By creating alternative pathways for the reaction to occur, more of the reactant particles have enough energy. The reaction is then faster, safer, and, in industrial contexts, cheaper.

Alloying can be a powerful process because it combines components in specific combinations to produce a substance that can achieve what the individual elements cannot.

Another important alloy in history is steel, which is still the most widely produced metal. Persians initiated the Iron Age by developing carbon steel in the 16th century BCE. The combination of iron and carbon results in steel, which is much harder than pure iron. The hardness of steel led to improved agricultural tools and weapons. The addition of metals such as magnesium, nickel, and chromium to carbon steel adds further characteristics to the alloy. These additives give the steel different properties, such as being stainless, and wear or corrosion resistant. Not every combination of elements produces a better, more useful alloy, but when you find one that works, the results can allow you to accomplish things previously out of reach. “In the first 4,000 years or so of steel making, the early chemists and metallurgists had no real idea what they were doing, and thus found it very difficult to optimize their processes. Add to this difficulty the large and very diverse selection of iron ores found in nature—frequently with phosphorus and silicon atoms causing a nuisance—and you may appreciate some of the complexity of the problem. Simply copying a successful procedure might not give a satisfactory product with iron ore from another mine.” 1 However, they kept at it, giving themselves and their societies new opportunities for growth and development.

Medicine is one field where the concept of alloying comes in to play. Sometimes, a combination of two or more drugs can have a greater benefit than each drug individually. For example, chemotherapy drugs can be so toxic that they are almost certain to produce potentially fatal side effects. But combining them with another drug that reduces the impact of the side effects can make the treatment effective. In other cases, a chemotherapy drug may only be designed to target a particular biochemical pathway. If used in isolation, the cancer cells may simply develop resistance and use alternate pathways, rendering the drugs useless. Combining drugs that target different pathways leads to a drastically higher chance of destroying a tumor or halting its growth.


Theoretical learning cannot prepare you to understand all the nuances of your particular life, such as your partner or the dynamics of your team. And if you relied solely on your own experiences to learn, you would be condemned to repeat the mistakes of others, which is extremely ineffective. Theory and experience together create knowledge, and both serve to augment and advance the capabilities of the other.


Aristotle * discussed five components of knowledge. “They are what we today would call science or scientific knowledge (episteme), art or craft knowledge (techne), prudence or practical knowledge (phronesis), intellect or intuitive apprehension (nous) and wisdom (sophia).” 6 These


A quote from one of his journals reads, “Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle.…Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on the ice in Flanders…Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner” 9 These notes suggest that no one has the time to do everything, and the alloy that is our knowledge must contain what we can learn from others.

Notes: 1) Leonardo de vinci 


“Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle.…Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on the ice in Flanders…Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner” 9 These notes suggest that no one has the time to do everything, and the alloy that is our knowledge must contain what we can learn from others. Leonardo also readily combined knowledge from different disciplines, his understanding of nature informing his art, or his theatrical experiences pushing him to understand more about optics. His interdisciplinary approach strengthened his knowledge by giving it a varied practicality and usefulness. “Thus, Leonardo became a disciple of both experience and received wisdom. More important, he came to see that the progress of science came from a dialogue between the two. That in turn helped him realize that knowledge also came from a related dialogue: that between experiment and theory.” 10 In building our knowledge, the environment we are in plays a huge part, as it is the source of our experiences. For this component, Leonardo was lucky, because he was born at a time and place that valued the mixing of ideas from different disciplines. In 15th century Florence there were others who brought multidisciplinary thinking to design and creativity. “This mixing of ideas from different disciplines became the norm as people of diverse talents intermingled. Silk makers worked with goldbeaters to create enchanted fashions.


Sharing knowledge is a part of how you test it, seeing how much stronger your alloy really is after you’ve added some new information.


start with what we get in terms of genetics and environment, but at a certain point we take over control of what we can become. Understanding that knowledge is an alloy of experience and theory that can be further strengthened with elements of curiosity, imagination and sharing gives us the ability to develop it as a true source of power in our lives. —Sidebar: What works for one part of the system doesn’t necessarily work for all.


Consider a person possessing deep engineering skills with an ability to explain ideas clearly. Surely they are more valuable than someone with just the engineering skills. Now add empathy, humility, resilience, and drive. Now this person is incredibly valuable.


The word selection can be confusing, because its common usage implies choice: I’m selecting this over that. In reality, the concept means that the more favorable a trait is for a particular environment, the higher the chance of that organism living long enough to procreate. Biologist Geerat J. Vermeij describes it as “nonrandom elimination.”


As each generation contends with its environment, the struggle for the resources needed for survival means that any traits that promote survival will likely get passed on. Thus, over time, the frequency of traits within a population changes as a response to environmental conditions. This is the definition of natural selection.


As Rafe Sagarin notes in Learning from the Octopus, goes on to note, “Natural selection … is an incredibly simple process requiring just three simple elements—variation between individuals, environmental conditions that favor or select certain variants over others, and a means to reproduce those variants that are better suited to


As Rafe Sagarin notes in Learning from the Octopus, goes on to note, “Natural selection … is an incredibly simple process requiring just three simple elements—variation between individuals, environmental conditions that favor or select certain variants over others, and a means to reproduce those variants that are better suited to the environment.” 2


One of the key elements to selecting for positive traits is that they have to be repeatable. Either the genetic mutation or the learning must be able to be passed on to the next generation. If adaptive behaviors can be used and developed in a successive series of situations to increase the fitness of the individual, and the species, those behaviors will be selected for.


To confuse matters, extinctions don’t occur in isolation. Ecosystems are full of complex, nonlinear interdependencies. When one species dies out, it may take others with it. Sometimes, the interrelationships are straightforward. If a prey species goes extinct, it’s logical for its main predator to do likewise if it lacks alternatives. Or the interrelationship may be less direct. If a predator goes extinct, its prey may be able to breed in greater numbers. This can put a strain on its own prey and drive this prey to extinction. Thus, we cannot predict the outcome of an extinction.


Generalist species are far more resilient than specialists. A rat or a cockroach can survive almost anywhere, a panda less so.


« So how does a business survive in constantly changing environments?When change hits, a common response is denial or trying to adapt with a business model that no longer works. We can influence the outcome in changing environments more rapidly by first recognizing that we actually need to survive and then moving to survive with new ideas. » Roberta Bondar  9

Languages are, in a sense, subject to the pressures of natural selection, which means they can also die out if they aren’t well suited to their environment. French


Shifts in power result in shifts of language usage. Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow explain in The Story of French that “three main events pushed the language from one phase to the next: the fall of the Roman Empire, the conquest of England, and the rise and fall of Paris as a center of power.” 10 Early French responded to these changes by mutating—picking up words from other languages—which helped it survive by keeping it useful.


The spread of French meant that the language faced more complex environmental pressures. It began to settle into the modern version of the language in response to these pressures. First, “by the 12th century writers from around Paris were making a conscious effort to eliminate dialectical characteristics in their writing so they could be understood by a larger number of people.” 12 Second, as it became the pan-European language of business, its grammar, spelling and precise meanings had to be set so as to avoid disputes based on interpretation. Finally, the growing popularity of printed materials pressured the language to commit to rules and standards, as well as concise characters to save on cost. French was able to adapt accordingly. Gothic characters were replaced with Roman ones,


French eventually overcame the lack of words in scientific and technical fields and contributed many inventions and innovations to the world. But the point is that in order for languages to evolve, they must have the flexibility to adapt. Any measures that try to constrain flexibility risk the language becoming unusable and eventually extinct. To this day France responds to the pressures on French created by the global prominence of English (and Mandarin, and Spanish) by trying to make it easy for people to learn French. “French lexicographers do their spring cleaning regularly so that the language doesn’t hold on to words it doesn’t need.”


The lens of evolution and natural selection suggests that trying to freeze a language, or trying to maintain tight control on its evolution, is the exact wrong reaction in terms of preventing extinction. If a language cannot adapt it will cease to be useful. If it ceases to be useful, it will go extinct.


The story of the evolution of French can be contrasted with that of Latin. Latin is perhaps the best-known dead language. The debate over what makes a dead language and whether any particular language falls in that category is endless.


While geopolitical changes after the fall of the Roman Empire strengthened French, they gradually killed Latin. This


While geopolitical changes after the fall of the Roman Empire strengthened French, they gradually killed Latin. This doesn’t mean no one knows it or that it is not in use in any manner. Latin remains the official language of Vatican City and has a significant role in Catholicism, often used in writing by officials. It’s used in some traditional, ceremonial situations, like the graduation ceremonies at Oxford University


For scholars who study old texts, a knowledge of Latin is useful so they don’t need to rely on translations, which may be subjective. For these reasons, Latin is unlikely to disappear altogether. But the fact that it is not spoken as a native language puts it into the dead category.


The main reason Latin fell out of use is its complexity. Learning Latin is far more arduous than learning any of the languages it spawned as there are numerous ways to modify each word depending on the context.


Natural selection and extinction are not just about plants and animals. It is important to understanding how the world changes over time, and how these changes force an adaptive response. If we resist adapting, we ultimately contribute to our own end. There is a constant interplay between environmental changes and a species’ response to them. The value of how a species responds is evaluated simply by survival. If we want to understand why some traits stick around, why some customs carry through many generations, and why some ideas take root and spread through a population, we have to look at their usefulness in their environment.


“In other words, living things do only as well as they have to rather than optimize.”


There are so many humans on the planet that even if only 20% were trying to move ahead, it’s enough that they wouldn’t leave much behind for the rest of us. There are enough people trying to get smarter, better, and more of the limited resources that are available, that it puts direct pressure on everyone to keep up.


flightless birds like ostriches usually have small, useless wings that are the leftovers from the ones that once gave them flight. The human goosebump reaction to stress or fear is a vestigial response, based on how our ancestors would have fluffed up their fur to look bigger when confronted with a predator. Some snakes have the remnants of a pelvis from the time when they had legs, as do whales. 1 The presence or absence of pelvic remains is one way we classify snake species. Pigs have useless toes raised off the ground. The parasite responsible for malaria contains the vestiges of a chloroplast in its single cell. Moles have skin-covered, de-evolved eyes hidden beneath their fur, despite being blind. 2 So why don’t vestigial structures just go away? It all comes down to natural selection. An organism’s traits are only selected for or against by natural selection if they have any impact on its chances of survival. If a vestigial structure confers no benefit but causes no harm, there is no reason for it to disappear.


What this means on the human life timescale is that if you are compromising your physical health or your sanity, you are not adapting.


No innovation comes into existence perfectly hewn. Error is thus necessary for the generation of variation. » Geerat Vermeij  19


Don’t reinvent the wheel, repurpose


Don’t reinvent the wheel, repurpose it


feathers first emerged in dinosaurs for the purposes of insulation or attracting mates, not flight. Natural selection selected for dinosaurs that had feathers because they better allowed them to survive and reproduce. This is the adaptation: feathers first provided heat and attractiveness. Later on, however, feathers also became useful for flight as observed in the modern bird.


In Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World, Steven Johnson traces the technology of the musical machine devised by the Banu Musa through music boxes and mechanical toys and player pianos, and shows how the innovations generated in the pursuit of this entertainment were the foundation of the frequency-hopping technology so essential to our wireless age in the form of cellular phones, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. 23


do what you can, with what you’ve got, where you are.


Complacency will kill you. The stronger we are relative to others, the less willing we generally are to change. We see strength as an immediate advantage that we don’t want to compromise. However, it’s not strength that survives, but adaptability. Strength becomes rigidity. Eventually your competitors will match your strength or find innovative ways to neutralize it. Real success comes from being flexible enough to change, to let go of what worked in the past, and to focus on what you need to thrive in the future.


The name comes from zoologist Robert T Paine, who compared them to the special stone known as a keystone, that is used at the top of an arch to ensure its structural stability. Without the keystone, the arch would collapse. It is a small component, but everything else depends on it.


The Law of the Minimum states that the yield of a crop will always be dictated by the essential nutrient that is available at the lowest level. No matter how abundant the other essential nutrients are, being deficient in one will always limit the crop’s growth. If the level of that nutrient is increased, another will become the limiting factor. One way to envision this is as a bucket with a hole through which water leaks out. The bucket cannot fill to the brim as a result.

If you think about the narrow range of temperatures that humans can exist in, compared to all the possible temperatures that exist in our solar system, you can appreciate that significant change in external factors like light, air quality, etc. can devastate the stability of an ecosystem. So too with any business. External stability is important for overall success.

The telegraph “had enormous advantages of easier use, much lower cost, less interference in transmission, and an already-developed infrastructure as well as users who had [by now] incorporated the standard telegram into their business routines.” 6 Fax’s first niche was with the newspapers—a niche that it helped solidify by creating an expectation that only faxed photographs could fill. “Judged strictly by numbers, facsimile was a minor technology. Less than a thousand transmitters and receivers existed in 1940. Their impact was greatly out of proportion to their numbers, however, because they enabled newspapers to print the latest photographs with the latest stories, visually


Human and octopus eyes are similar, despite the closest common ancestor having lived 550 million years ago and only possessing a basic eyespot.


Originally a medicinal tonic, Coke’s first advertising efforts were a turn away from these roots to market its product as a beverage for “relaxation and enjoyment.”


Using pretty women, celebrity endorsements, and vast sums of money—$750,000 in 1909 alone, which is over $18 million in today’s dollars—Coke convinced consumers that they weren’t just buying a drink. They were buying a lifestyle.


Around this time, they “created the first successful Coke slogan in years: ‘Things go better with Coke.’ What went better didn’t matter so much—Coke could just as well spark romance as childhood friendship. It was left to the consumer to fill in the blank.”


Blinking is another example. When dust or bugs approach the eye, the eye lid automatically closes without having to voluntarily contract any muscle to close the eye. These simple examples demonstrate that self-preservation


Blinking is another example. When dust or bugs approach the eye, the eye lid automatically closes without having to voluntarily contract any muscle to close the eye. These simple examples demonstrate that self-preservation is hardwired in.


When human beings are faced with imminent danger, this mechanism kicks in with the mobilization of the sympathetic nervous system. The results in the body are a sharp increase in blood sugar levels, constriction of blood vessels, increase in heart rate, and the diversion of blood from nonessential organs to heart and skeletal muscles. These are responses that help the mammal deal most effectively with the situation they are in.


Just like human mothers, many animals are willing to go to great lengths to ensure the survival of their offspring and therefore their species in turn. Some will literally sacrifice their own lives, like the black lace weave spider, which will allow its babies to eat it. Some animals, like African elephants, zebras, and sea lions will work together in large groups to protect the offspring of others. Orcas and dolphins remain awake for a full month after the birth of their young to care for and protect them. Other animals, including polar bears and penguins, may go months without eating for the sake of their offspring. Marmots will delay their own reproduction if others in their group need help with childcare. Worker honeybees even completely neglect to reproduce so they can look after their queen’s babies—and if they don’t, the other bees destroy their eggs. 1 Once they become too old to be useful for foraging, the other bees will either kill the workers or refuse to let them into the hive, leaving them to starve to death. Drones, which are male bees, die during the mating process, having successfully passed on their genes. Any drones that don’t manage to mate are likewise killed by other bees, so the hive does not need to waste resources feeding them.


Why are automatic reactions programmed in? The desire for survival seems a given, but it exists in organisms that don’t have anywhere near the size of cortex that we do. These widespread instincts exist without the ability to philosophize about them because the longer an organism survives, the greater its chances of passing along its genetics, and that is the ultimate point of evolution.


Sometimes it is innocuous, like when we go on a roller coaster. We tell ourselves it’s perfectly safe, so the biological reaction of terror gets processed as a thrill. Sometimes, though, we override them because our situation seems to demand it, and we put ourselves in situations of chronic stress and pressure. So self-preservation instincts are complex.


We choose fight or flight when we think we have a chance to succeed. Freeze mode usually takes over when the accumulation of stressors is so great that we can no longer really function. By freezing we hope to preserve the little life we have left. The drive for survival is deeply ingrained in our behavioral responses.


How then do we understand people who risk their lives for a cause? What propels someone to put their immediate survival in jeopardy in support of a possible future?


that for humans survival is not merely a binary like dead/alive. We don’t want to just continue breathing, but to have a life that we perceive as having meaning, value, or at least a point.


Derinkuyu is the deepest of the cities yet discovered beneath Cappadocia. In 1963, a Turkish man renovating his basement found something astounding: an entire room behind its wall. From there, archaeologists discovered a whole city snaking beneath the ground, carved into the soft yet sturdy rock.


Acting in survival mode is not sustainable long-term. Hoarding and hiding are not lifelong strategies.


Any time we’re fighting to preserve ourselves in an emergency situation, we need more of a concrete plan than hiding and hoarding. In addition to our natural instincts, we need to move beyond our evolutionary programming and consider how we can survive long-term. Sometimes our immediate self-preservation instincts can backfire,


Any time we’re fighting to preserve ourselves in an emergency situation, we need more of a concrete plan than hiding and hoarding. In addition to our natural instincts, we need to move beyond our evolutionary programming and consider how we can survive long-term. Sometimes our immediate self-preservation instincts can backfire, putting us in situations of little long-term benefit.


Closed systems, those without any new inputs, die in changing environments. Ultimately, after 16 generations of intermarriages, the Habsburgs ended up with such serious disabilities that they wiped the family out. Their success in controlling Europe proved to be a Pyrrhic victory. The final member, Charles II, was infertile and thus unable to produce an heir. 5 He also experienced dire health from birth. He did not learn to speak until the age of four due to his distended jaw, could not walk until he was eight, frequently drooled, was of low intellectual ability, and was barely able to speak comprehensibly. His infertility may have been the result of a pituitary hormone deficiency, and he also suffered from kidney problems. 6 Charles II died in his late thirties, young for someone of his wealth even at the time. He reportedly had the intellectual capabilities of a small child. Replication is necessary but not sufficient for survival. The more you copy something, the more it weakens. Thus, replication alone is not always beneficial. Imagine a teacher photocopying a worksheet for a class then throwing away the original. The next year they make photocopies of the photocopies then again throw away the originals. As the years go by, the quality of the sheet progressively gets worse because each copy will pass on errors and introduce new ones. Minor problems compound with each copy.

There are four elements of commander’s intent: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The first two are the responsibility of the senior commander, the latter two the job of the subordinate commander. In order to develop these skills commanders must consider four criteria: Explain the rationale (not just the what and why, but how they arrived at a decision) Establish operational limits (identify what is completely off the table) Get feedback often (a continuous loop between levels) Recognize individual differences (the unique psychological makeup of each subordinate) 14


effective replication requires enough structure and space to produce a copy, but enough flexibility to adapt that copy to changes in the environment. Just because something has worked for a while doesn’t mean that it will continue to be effective in perpetuity. Maintaining a successful approach requires an ability to grow and modify that approach as required.


A shark doesn’t need little fish to clean its teeth in order to live that day, but overall the quality of the shark’s life is enhanced because clean teeth mean healthy teeth, which will give it more years to feed on prey. Cooperation


There is possibly no better example of the power of cooperation to transform existing structures and create new capabilities than the relationships required to achieve success as a symphony orchestra. The interaction between the musicians, and them with the conductor, involves a huge amount of trust and commitment to produce something that is greater than the sum of its parts.


accumulate. And there is an element of inertia here. The more encompassing a shared belief gets, the more we forget it is a human construct. Eventually, the mass of belief becomes so large that we consider it an inescapable part of the natural world. There is no doubt that we can no longer operate without cooperating in these shared beliefs.


In chimpanzees, “the alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in time of trouble.” 2 One of the drawbacks of hierarchies is the lack of perceived value of those who are at the bottom. “An efficient new gathering strategy devised by a low-ranking chimpanzee, for example, might not get replicated just because of her status in society.” 3 Hierarchies in the human world act as information filters causing us to potentially miss opportunities and ideas.


In organizations that claim to have a flat structure with no leaders, people often just end up more frazzled than normal as they attempt to navigate the inevitable unspoken power structures.


If we can’t avoid hierarchies, we need to recognize their presence and focus on structuring them in the most beneficial way for everyone involved, like having prestige associated with belonging to the group rather than being conferred on individuals. The key is to be aware of hierarchies and work with, not against them. We want to use hierarchies as a tool, not be used by them.


We all look for leaders, even if we are looking at ourselves.


the ability to identify and respond to incentives is an intrinsic part of our biological makeup. Therefore, their influences on our behavior are not always rational. We often evaluate the value of an incentive through an incredibly biased lens made up of our self-esteem, our personal narrative, and our physiological state.


We often evaluate the value of an incentive through an incredibly biased lens made up of our self-esteem, our personal narrative, and our physiological state.


The darker side of incentives is that sometimes pursuing our wants can rewire the brain so that these wants become requirements.


Incentives have a powerful impact that spreads out like ripples on a pond. The short-term incentives in both politics and business impact every area of our lives. To change a system involving humans, we need to change the incentives.


We are vulnerable to the influence of incentives—whether from money, prestige, or power. Most insidious is when an incentive is designed to appeal to our personal narrative about the kind of person we are. No one wants to be thought of as bad, so we often perform intellectual contortions to justify our pursuit of an incentive as good.


Money is desirable, and therefore it is a common incentive that modifies behavior everywhere. But money alone isn’t often enough. Undoubtedly if you ask people whether they would harm thousands of children for money, most would say no. Therefore, in order to understand the real power of incentives you have to look at the psychological condition they create. Humans don’t like cognitive dissonance—“the state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent.” 16 We engage in self-justifying rhetoric to reduce this dissonance.


Think of getting together with a group of friends every Saturday to play board games. Numerous studies have shown that we would cease this behavior if we knew we were going to win every time. Winning is fun. Guaranteed winning is not.


Winning a game against your friends is not life-changing, and thus the incentive to have fun in the process of playing is more compelling that the incentive to be sure about winning. Conversely, if an amount of money was involved that would allow us to quit our jobs and travel around the world, we would go for the guaranteed win every time.


We often instead make choices that result in long-term negative consequences. A doughnut may provide an immediate energy reward, but a doughnut a day for years will lead to a long-term health problem.


For humans, we have to be careful though, to make sure minimizing our energy output increases our effectiveness and doesn’t lead to laziness.


Change is costly for most organisms. It can be easier to keep doing whatever has guaranteed their survival so far than to try something new that might fail and waste energy or endanger them. The instinct to minimize energy output can lead us to be resistant to change or risk-taking.


Humans, like every other species, are energy minimizers—intensely so. Our brain has developed as an energy minimizer, as have the rest of our body parts. Psychologists have a word for the efficiency mechanism in how we think: heuristics.


In his studies of firefighters, for example, Gary Klein demonstrates the accuracy of the quick decisions that firefighters make in the course of their jobs, and how this accuracy increases over time. 2 Why? Fires are governed by rules of chemistry and physics, and thus exhibit consistent behaviors. The more you interact with fires the more you will build knowledge that allows you to intuitively make good decisions in future fire situations.


however, we would increase our skills and knowledge if we put the effort into answering the harder question of what we think about something and not relying on the emotional shortcut.


Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, and reflection is an energy expenditure.


You must always be willing to adjust for new information, but be knowledgeable enough to be selective about what you let in.


While most people assume that experience is the key to learning, the key is actually reflection.


While most people assume that experience is the key to learning, the key is actually reflection. Journaling works because it prompts reflection. Keeping a journal, where you chronicle your use of the models and your expected results, allows you to build a repertoire that you can begin to rely on time and again.


## The Meaning of Life, The School of Life


The mutual permission involved in sex is dramatic and at the core of our desire. We’re implicitly saying to another person through our unclothing that they have been placed in a tiny, intensely policed, category of people; that we have granted them an extraordinary privilege. Therefore, it is not so much what our bodies do in sex that generates our excitement; it is what happens in our brains. Acceptance


The word ‘nepotism’ was born when a series of popes took to appointing their nephews (nipote in Italian), along with other family members, to top jobs irrespective of their talents and simply on the basis of their connections.


A meaningful life is close to, but at points importantly different from, a happy life.


Meaningful activities aren’t necessarily those we do most often. They are those we value most highly and will, from the perspective of our deaths, miss most deeply.


We have to work out, by a process of experience and introspection, what counts as meaningful in our eyes. Pleasure may manifest itself immediately, but our taste in meaning may be more elusive. We can be relatively far into our lives before we securely identify what imbues them with meaning.


It is because of the unique structure of a family that an 82-year-old woman and a 4-year-old boy can become friends or that a 56-year-old dentist and an 11-year-old schoolgirl can have an in-depth conversation about tyre pressure or splash each other at the beach. The family creates an environment in which there is enough safety to allow for encounters with radical strangeness.


According to his closest companions, Paul Cézanne was often prickly, irritable and rude. Under the sway of depressed moods, he could grow tyrannical and mean. But none of this was obvious from his work. If we were to judge him from his labours alone, we would see him as deeply patient, confident and mature, with a powerful sense of harmony and balance and a constant empathy for other humans and for nature itself. In a sense, Cézanne’s work was better than he was. This is perhaps a definition of what all work can be when it goes well: a more elevated version of the person who created it.


The dentist, in her white jacket, is no longer the awkward person she felt herself becoming over the weekend. Work gives us a chance, rare within the overall economy of our lives, to give precedence to our better natures.


Our lives have to be lived in appalling ignorance: we know nothing of when and how we will die; the thoughts of others remain largely hidden from us; we often can’t make sense of our own moods; we are driven by excitements and fears we can barely make sense of. But in work, we can build up a very accurate and extensive field of understanding. We can amaze with the precision of our explanations. A wine maker might reveal that the slight taste of caramel comes from the fact that the grapes were left unusually long in the back of the truck just after they were harvested; a picture restorer will point out that a painting was relined, probably in France, in the 1850s; a dance instructor will be able to tell from the way you walk that you

Money is simply a resource that extends the powers of its possessor.


‘In the minds of geniuses, we find – once more – our own neglected thoughts.’


Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) put it: ‘In the minds of geniuses, we find – once more – our own neglected thoughts.’


Networking has a bad name; it is associated with self-enrichment, egoism and snobbery. But in essence it is a search for help. It springs from a fundamentally modest awareness of how fragile and limited each of us is, and how much we need the support and strength of others.


Jesus of Nazareth networked extensively in order to put together a team of disciples who could help him spread a message about love, redemption and sacrifice.


To network means to filter intelligently, to recognise that one cannot – and indeed should not – try to get to know everyone. It involves aligning one’s path through the world with a mission. It implies a wise acknowledgement that we do not have unlimited time.


Every age possesses a superior kind of knowledge in some area, which it usually forgets to hand on to succeeding selves.


Remembering what it was like not to be who we are now is vital to our growth and integrity. The best professors remain friends with their past. They remember what it was like not to know about their special topic, and so don’t talk over the heads of their students. The best bosses are in touch with their own experience of starting out as a lowly employee.


Good parents keep in touch with the feelings of injustice and sensitivity they had in early childhood. Kindly wealthy people remember what it was like not to dare to walk into a costly food shop. We are always better long-term lovers if we have an avenue of loyalty back to who we were when we first met our beloveds and were at an apogee of gratitude and modesty.


the weak are stronger than we suppose; the strong are weaker than we imagine.


We need to get home to remember who we are. Our homes have a memorialising function, and what they help us to remember is, strangely enough, ourselves.


Without there being anything grandiose or supernatural in the idea, our homes are also temples; they are temples to us. We are not expecting to be worshipped, but we are trying to make a place that – like a temple – adequately embodies our spiritual values and merits.


Around 130 million books have been published in the history of humanity; a heavy reader will at best get through 6,000 in a lifetime. Most of them won’t be much fun or very memorable. Books are like people; we meet many but fall in love very seldom.


This idea comes from an unusual source: the history of religious pilgrimage. Religions have traditionally shown a surprising degree of sympathy for our impulse to travel. They have accepted that we cannot develop our souls just by staying at home. They have insisted – with what can now seem like an alien intensity – on the gravity of going on a trip. They have channelled the raw impulse to take off into


to be political is to care about the happiness of strangers.


At a sombre moment in the Peloponnesian war, the ancient Athenian statesman Pericles (d. 429 BCE) made a speech, known as the Funeral Oration, in which he attempted to define what made Athenian society so admirable and so worth fighting and dying for. He covered territory that might sound unfamiliar today. He praised his fellow citizens for their attitudes to beauty, for the way they approached exercise, for the manner in which they entertained each other at home, for their sensitivity to their natural surroundings and for the open, polite manner they had in public places.

We stay up late, ruminate in the bath, wake up early, write down our thoughts, go for a walk, and feel perceptibly lightened and refreshed by the process of mastering emotions and the alchemy of converting feelings into ideas.


We stay up late, ruminate in the bath, wake up early, write down our thoughts, go for a walk, and feel perceptibly lightened and refreshed by the process of mastering emotions and the alchemy of converting feelings into ideas. Without anything grandiose being meant by the word, we are driven to philosophise, implicitly siding with Socrates’s dictum that the unanalysed life is not worth living, or at least is rather uncomfortable.


We rightly think that fear is the enemy of the well-lived life. But there is a powerful way in which fear can play an opposite and more constructive role: it can be the psychological force that positively propels us towards a more meaningful existence.


Only a small number of people ever self-consciously write their autobiographies. It is a task we associate with celebrities and the very old, but it is, in the background, a universal activity. We may not be publishing our stories,


## Still the Mind: An Introduction to Meditation, Alan W. Watts


unless one has something to give people, there is nothing one can do to help them. Just because I thought I ought to help, it didn’t mean that I had anything to give.


When you make a decision, does that come from somewhere other than you? No, it comes from the depths of you, of which you are not really aware. You encompass far more than anything you know about in a conscious way.


We are aware of these changes only because of the contrast within them. Of course you would not know something was on if it did not occasionally go off, and you would not know it was off if it did not sometimes go on.


We are aware of these changes only because of the contrast within them. Of course you would not know something was on if it did not occasionally go off, and you would not know it was off if it did not sometimes go on. So I have often asked the question “How would you know you are alive unless you had once been dead?”


“Well,” we might say, “how can it be? It has no civilization. It has no house. It has no automobiles. It has no pianos, no art galleries, and no religion.” But the potato might say, “I don’t need them.


“Well,” we might say, “how can it be? It has no civilization. It has no house. It has no automobiles. It has no pianos, no art galleries, and no religion.” But the potato might say, “I don’t need them. It’s you poor uncivilized human beings who have to have all this crap around you to tell you who you are and what it’s all about. You are messy and inefficient, and you are cluttering up the planet with your culture. But I, the potato, have it all built into me.” “Well,” we might say, “that’s impossible, because you are stuck in one place all the time. How can you know anything about the world?”


It took many years to find out that bees communicate with each other by dancing, and that was such a shock that one entomologist at UCLA said, “I have the most passionate reluctance to accept this evidence.”


the great Sixth Patriarch of China pointed out, you must learn to distinguish between a living Buddha and a stone Buddha, because if a buddha was simply one who was not affected by anything, then lumps of wood and pieces of stone would be Buddhas. And perhaps they are in their own way, but that wasn’t the point he was making. His point was that if you think that the greatest ideal in life is to be invulnerable, then you are on your way to becoming geological rather than spiritual.


After all, to be human you have to have within you a touch of rascality. When God created Adam, he put in him just a touch of the wayward spirit, in the same way that one adds a little salt to a stew. If this slight oddity, this bit of unpredictability, had not been there, nothing would ever have happened, because Adam would never have tasted the apple.


According to the Buddhist idea of reincarnation, we have all occupied every position in the hierarchy, or on the Wheel of Becoming, as the Buddhists call it, since the image of time they use is a wheel. In this view, by moving around the wheel, you eventually realize that every position to which you can shift is the same position you were always in.


According to the Buddhist idea of reincarnation, we have all occupied every position in the hierarchy, or on the Wheel of Becoming, as the Buddhists call it, since the image of time they use is a wheel. In this view, by moving around the wheel, you eventually realize that every position to which you can shift is the same position you were always in. While you are shifting you may feel there is a change going on, but once you have settled into your new position, it feels like any other settled position always felt. From the inside we know what it feels like to have a settled position because from time to time we can change — but, as the French say, the more it changes, the more it remains the same.


Big explanations have little explanations upon their backs to bite them, and little explanations have lesser explanations, and so on infinitum.


You are put in the position of feeling that it is absolutely necessary to be different from the way you are, but there is absolutely nothing you can do about it because being the way you are, you can’t be different from your self.


One might well ask, “Why do you want to love God?” And the answer is invariably, because God is the most powerful ruler, and it is always best to be on the side of the big battalions. Most often that is the real reason why people believe in God, and it comes down to the fact that they are looking out for the safety of their own spiritual skins.


## Epistemology in Classical Indian Philosophy, Stephen Phillips


Theory of knowledge, pramāṇa-śāstra,


most striking of which is a focus on a belief’s source in questions of justification. Mainstream classical Indian epistemology is dominated by theories about pedigree, i.e., views about knowledge-generating processes, called pramāṇa, “knowledge sources.” The principal candidates are perception,


“mental dispositions” called saṃskāra.


For example, several words, the most common of which is ‘jñāna’, are standardly rendered with the word ‘knowledge’ in English (e.g., Bhatt 1989). However, proper Sanskrit usage allows “false” jñāna, whereas there is no false knowledge as the words are used in (analytic) English. There is a deeper lesson here than


Knowledge is cognition that has been produced in the right way. Cognitions are moments of consciousness, not species of belief, but we may say that cognitions form beliefs in forming dispositions and that veridical cognitions form true beliefs. A knowledge episode—to speak in the Indian manner—is a cognition generated in the right fashion.


## Money, Yuval Noah Harari


even today coins and banknotes are a rare form of money. The sum total of money in the world is about $ 60 trillion, yet the sum total of coins and banknotes is less than $ 6 trillion. More than 90 per cent of all money–more than $ 50 trillion appearing in our accounts–exists only on computer servers. Accordingly, most business transactions are executed by moving electronic data from one computer file to another, without any exchange of physical cash. Only a criminal buys a house, for example, by handing over a suitcase full of banknotes. As long as people are willing to trade goods and services in exchange for electronic data, it’s even better than shiny coins and crisp banknotes–lighter, less bulky, and easier to keep track of.


This is perhaps its most basic quality. Everyone always wants money because everyone else also always wants money, which means you can exchange money for whatever you want or need.


Ideal types of money enable people not merely to turn one thing into another, but to store wealth as well. Many valuables cannot be stored–such as time or beauty. Some things can be stored only for a short time, such as strawberries. Other things are more durable, but take up a lot of space and require expensive facilities and care. Grain, for example, can be stored for years, but to do so you need to build huge storehouses and guard against rats, mould, water, fire and thieves. Money, whether paper, computer bits or cowry shells, solves these problems.


When a wealthy farmer sold his possessions for a sack of cowry shells and travelled with them to another province, he trusted that upon reaching his destination other people would be willing to sell him rice, houses and fields in exchange for the shells. Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.


money appeared in ancient Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC. This was the silver shekel.


SET WEIGHTS OF precious metals eventually gave birth to coins. The first coins in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia.


In the first century AD, Roman coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the markets of India, even though the closest Roman legion was thousands of kilometres away. The Indians had such a strong confidence in the denarius and the image of the emperor that when local rulers struck coins of their own they closely imitated the denarius, down to the portrait of the Roman emperor!


People continued to speak mutually incomprehensible languages, obey different rulers and worship distinct gods, but all believed in gold and silver and in gold and silver coins.


Merchants travelling between India and the Mediterranean would notice the difference in the value of gold. In order to make a profit, they would buy gold cheaply in India and sell it dearly in the Mediterranean. Consequently, the demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value. At the same time the Mediterranean would experience an influx of gold, whose value would consequently drop. Within a short time the value of gold in India and the Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people believed in gold would cause Indians to start believing in it as well. Even if Indians still had no real use for gold, the fact that Mediterranean people wanted it would be enough to make the Indians value it. Similarly, the fact that another person believes in cowry shells, or dollars, or electronic data, is enough to strengthen our own belief in them, even if that person is otherwise hated,


When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand.


Money has an even darker side. For although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour–we trust the coin they hold.


Economics is a notoriously complicated subject. To make things easier, let’s imagine a simple example. Samuel Greedy, a shrewd financier, founds a bank in El Dorado, California. A. A. Stone, an up-and-coming contractor in El Dorado, finishes his first big job, receiving payment in cash to the tune of $ 1 million. He deposits this sum in Mr Greedy’s bank. The bank now has $ 1 million in capital. In the meantime, Jane McDoughnut, an experienced but impecunious El Dorado chef, thinks she sees a business opportunity–there’s no really good bakery in her part of town. But she doesn’t have enough money of her own to buy a proper facility complete with industrial ovens, sinks, knives and pots. She goes to the bank, presents her business plan to Greedy, and persuades him that it’s a worthwhile investment. He issues her a $ 1 million loan, by crediting her account in the bank with that sum. McDoughnut now hires Stone, the contractor, to build and furnish her bakery. His price is $ 1,000,000. When she pays him, with a cheque drawn on her account, Stone deposits it in his account in the Greedy bank. So how much money does Stone have in his bank account? Right, $ 2 million. How much money–cash–is actually located in the bank’s safe? Yes, $ 1 million. It doesn’t stop there. As contractors are wont to do, two months into the job Stone informs McDoughnut that, due to unforeseen problems and expenses, the bill for constructing the bakery will actually be $ 2 million. Mrs McDoughnut is not pleased, but she can hardly stop the job in the middle. So she pays another visit to the bank, convinces Mr Greedy to give her an additional loan, and he puts another $ 1 million in her account. She transfers the money to the contractor’s account. How much money does Stone have in his account now? He’s got $ 3 million. But how much money is actually sitting in the bank? Still just $ 1 million. In fact, the same $ 1 million that’s been in the bank all along. Current US banking law permits the bank to repeat this exercise seven more times. The contractor would eventually have $ 10 million in his account, even though the bank still has but $ 1 million in its vaults. Banks are allowed to loan $ 10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes. If all of the account holders at Barclays Bank suddenly demand their money, Barclays will promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). The same is true of Lloyds, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and all other banks in the world. It sounds like a giant Ponzi scheme, doesn’t it? But if it’s a fraud, then the entire modern economy is a fraud. The fact is, it’s not a deception, but rather a tribute to the amazing abilities of the human imagination. What enables banks–and the entire economy–to survive and flourish is our trust in the future.


In the bakery example, the discrepancy between the contractor’s account statement and the amount of money actually in the bank is Mrs McDoughnut’s bakery. Mr Greedy has put the bank’s money into the asset, trusting that one day it would be profitable. The bakery hasn’t baked a loaf of bread yet, but McDoughnut and Greedy anticipate that a year hence it will be selling thousands of loaves, rolls, cakes and cookies each day, at a handsome profit. Mrs McDoughnut will then be able to repay her loan, with interest. If at that point Mr Stone decides to withdraw his savings, Greedy will be able to come up with the cash. The entire enterprise is thus founded on trust in an imaginary future–the trust that the entrepreneur and the banker have in the bakery of their dreams, along with the contractor’s trust in the future solvency of the bank.


get it built if money could represent only tangible objects? No. In the present, she has a lot of dreams, but no tangible resources. The only way she could get her bakery built would be to find a contractor willing to work today and receive payment in a few years’ time, if and when the bakery starts making money. Alas, such contractors are rare breeds. So our entrepreneur is in a bind. Without a bakery, she can’t bake cakes. Without cakes, she can’t make money. Without money, she can’t hire a contractor. Without a contractor, she has no bakery. Humankind was trapped in this predicament for thousands of years. As a result, economies remained frozen. The way out of the trap was discovered only in the modern era, with the appearance of a new system based on trust in the future.


You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger.


Smith taught people to think about the economy as a ‘win-win situation’, in which my profits are also your profits. Not only can we both enjoy a bigger slice of pie at the same time, but the increase in your slice depends upon the increase in my slice. If I am poor, you too will be poor since I cannot buy your products or services. If I am rich, you too will be enriched since you can now sell me something. Smith denied the traditional contradiction between wealth and morality, and threw open the gates of heaven for the rich. Being rich meant being moral.


That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh who pours resources into a non-productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A pirate who loots a Spanish treasure fleet and buries a chest full of glittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is not a capitalist. But a hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income in the stock market is.


Medieval noblemen wore colourful robes of gold and silk, and devoted much of their time to attending banquets, carnivals and glamorous tournaments. In comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that afford them all the panache of a flock of crows, and they have little time for festivities. The typical venture capitalist rushes from one business meeting to another, trying to figure out where to invest his capital and following the ups and downs of the stocks and bonds he owns. True, his suits might be Versace and he might get to travel in a private jet, but these expenses are nothing compared to what he invests in increasing human production. It’s not just Versace-clad business


The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years–such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep. Banks and governments print money, but ultimately, it is the scientists who foot the bill.


The empires built by bankers and merchants in frock coats and top hats defeated the empires built by kings and noblemen in gold clothes and shining armour. The mercantile empires were simply much shrewder in financing their conquests. Nobody wants to pay taxes, but everyone is happy to invest.


In 1484 Christopher Columbus approached the king of Portugal with the proposal that he finance a fleet that would sail westward to find a new trade route to East Asia. Such explorations were a very risky and costly business. A lot of money was needed in order to build ships, buy supplies, and pay sailors and soldiers–and there was no guarantee that the investment would yield a return. The king of Portugal declined. Like a present-day start-up entrepreneur, Columbus did not give up. He pitched his idea to other potential investors in Italy, France, England, and again in Portugal. Each time he was rejected. He then tried his luck with Ferdinand and Isabella, rulers of newly united Spain. He took on some experienced lobbyists, and with their help he managed to convince Queen Isabella to invest. As every school-child knows, Isabella hit the jackpot. Columbus’ discoveries enabled the Spaniards to conquer America, where they established gold and silver mines as well as sugar and tobacco plantations that enriched the Spanish kings, bankers and merchants beyond their wildest dreams. A hundred years later, princes and bankers were willing to extend far more credit to Columbus’ successors, and they had more capital at their disposal, thanks to the treasures reaped from America.


The English, for instance, wasted a lot of capital in fruitless attempts to discover a north-western passage to Asia through the Arctic. Many other expeditions didn’t return at all. Ships hit icebergs, foundered in tropical storms, or fell victim to pirates. In order to increase the number of potential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, Europeans turned to limited liability joint-stock companies. Instead of a single investor betting all his money on a single rickety ship, the joint-stock company collected money from a large number of investors, each risking only a small portion of his capital. The risks were thereby curtailed, but no cap was placed on the profits. Even a small investment in the right ship could turn you into a millionaire.


Island after island fell to VOC mercenaries and a large part of Indonesia became a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800 did the Dutch state assume control of Indonesia, making it a Dutch national colony for the following 150 years. Today some people warn that twenty-first-century corporations are accumulating too much power. Early modern history shows just how far that can go if businesses are allowed to pursue their self-interest unchecked.


In 1821 the Greeks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire. The uprising aroused great sympathy in liberal and romantic circles in Britain–Lord Byron, the poet, even went to Greece to fight alongside the insurgents. But London financiers saw an opportunity as well. They proposed to the rebel leaders the issue of tradable Greek Rebellion Bonds on the London stock exchange. The Greeks would promise to repay the bonds, plus interest, if and when they won their independence. Private investors bought bonds to make a profit, or out of sympathy for the Greek cause, or both. The value of Greek Rebellion Bonds rose and fell on the London stock exchange in tempo with military successes and failures on the battlefields of Hellas. The Turks gradually gained the upper hand. With a rebel defeat imminent, the bondholders faced the prospect of losing their trousers. The bondholders’ interest was the national interest, so the British organised an international fleet that, in 1827, sank the main Ottoman flotilla in the Battle of Navarino. After centuries of subjugation, Greece was finally free. But freedom came with a huge debt that the new country had no way of repaying. The Greek economy was mortgaged to British creditors for decades to come.


This is why today a country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil bounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a fair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry.


belief in the free market is as naive as belief in Santa Claus. There simply is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves and charlatans. Markets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft and violence. It is the job of political systems to ensure trust by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces, courts and jails which will enforce the law.


This sounds bulletproof in theory, but in practice the bullets get through all too easily.


the Middle Ages, sugar was a rare luxury in Europe. It was imported from the Middle East at prohibitive prices and used sparingly as a secret ingredient in delicacies and snake-oil medicines. After large sugar plantations were established in America, ever-increasing amounts of sugar began to reach Europe. The price of sugar dropped and Europe developed an insatiable sweet tooth. Entrepreneurs met this need by producing huge quantities of sweets: cakes, cookies, chocolate, candy, and sweetened beverages such as cocoa, coffee and tea. The annual sugar intake of the average Englishman rose from near zero in the early seventeenth century to around eight kilograms in the early nineteenth century.


Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred. Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed. The Atlantic slave trade did not stem from racist hatred towards Africans. The individuals who bought the shares, the brokers who sold them, and the managers of the slave-trade companies rarely thought about the Africans.


The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.


There are, indeed, some positive signs. At least when we use purely material criteria–such as life expectancy, child mortality and calorie intake–the standard of living of the average human in 2014 is significantly higher than it was in 1914, despite the exponential growth in the number of humans.


Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, hence the economic and political system will stop attaching much value to them. 2. The system will continue to find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals. 3. The system will still find value in some unique individuals, but these will constitute a new elite of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.


all, liberalism did not become the dominant ideology simply because its philosophical arguments were the most valid. Rather, liberalism succeeded because there was abundant political, economic and military sense in ascribing value to every human being. On the mass battlefields of modern industrial wars and in the mass production lines of modern industrial economies, every human counted. There was value to every pair of hands that could hold a rifle or pull a lever.


Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909, wrote on 5 August 1917 in the New York Times that ‘democratic armies fight better than armies aristocratically organised and autocratically governed’ and that ‘the armies of nations in which the mass of the people determine legislation, elect their public servants, and settle questions of peace and war, fight better than the armies of an autocrat who rules by right of birth and by commission from the Almighty’.


armaments. Even if you care more about justice than victory, you should probably opt to replace your soldiers and pilots with autonomous robots and drones. Human soldiers murder, rape and pillage, and even when they try to behave themselves, they all too often kill civilians by mistake. Computers programmed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform to the latest rulings of the international criminal court.


Armies and corporations cannot function without intelligent agents, but they don’t need consciousness and subjective experiences. The conscious experiences of a flesh-and-blood taxi driver are infinitely richer than those of a self-driving car, which feels absolutely nothing. The taxi driver can enjoy music while navigating the busy streets of Seoul. His mind may expand in awe as he looks up at the stars and contemplates the mysteries of the universe. His eyes may fill with tears of joy when he sees his baby girl taking her very first step. But the system doesn’t need all that from a taxi driver. All it really wants is to bring passengers from point A to point B as quickly, safely and cheaply as possible. And the autonomous car will soon be able to do that far better than a human driver, even though it cannot enjoy music or be awestruck by the magic of existence. We should remind ourselves of the fate of horses during the Industrial Revolution. An ordinary farm horse can smell, love, recognise faces, jump over fences and do a thousand other things far better than a Model T Ford or a million-dollar Lamborghini. But cars nevertheless replaced horses because they were superior in the handful of tasks that the system really needed. Taxi drivers are highly likely to go the way of horses.


When they enter the classroom, however, they may well discover that the algorithms have got there first. Companies such as Mindojo are developing interactive algorithms that will not only teach me maths, physics and history, but will simultaneously study me and get to know exactly who I am. Digital teachers will closely monitor every answer I give, and how long it took me to give it. Over time they will discern my unique weaknesses as well as my strengths and will identify what gets me excited and what makes my eyelids droop. They could teach me thermodynamics or geometry in a way that suits my personality type, even if that particular method doesn’t suit 99 per cent of the other pupils. And these digital teachers will never lose their patience, never shout at me, and never go on strike. It remains unclear, however, why on earth I would need to know thermodynamics or geometry in a world containing such intelligent computer programs.


5,000 years ago much of Sumer was owned by imaginary gods such as Enki and Inanna. If gods can possess land and employ people, why not algorithms?


David Cope is a musicology professor at the University of California in Santa Cruz. He is also one of the more controversial figures in the world of classical music. Cope has written computer programs that compose concertos, chorales, symphonies and operas. His first creation was named EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence), which specialised in imitating the style of Johann Sebastian Bach. It took seven years to create the program, but once the work was done EMI composed 5,000 chorales à la Bach in a single day. Cope arranged for a performance of a few select chorales at a music festival in Santa Cruz. Enthusiastic members of the audience praised the stirring performance, and explained excitedly how the music had touched their innermost being. They didn’t know that it had been created by EMI rather than Bach, and when the truth was revealed some reacted with glum silence, while others shouted in anger. EMI continued to improve and learned to imitate Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninov and Stravinsky. Cope got EMI a contract and its first album–Classical Music Composed by Computer–sold surprisingly well. Publicity brought increasing hostility from classical-music buffs. Professor Steve Larson from the University of Oregon sent Cope a challenge for a musical showdown. Larson suggested that professional pianists play three pieces one after the other: one each by Bach, by EMI, and by Larson himself. The audience would then be asked to vote on who composed which piece. Larson was convinced that people would easily distinguish between soulful human compositions and the lifeless artefact of a machine. Cope accepted the challenge. On the appointed date hundreds of lecturers, students and music fans assembled in the University of Oregon’s concert hall. At the end of the performance, a vote was taken. The result? The audience thought that EMI’s piece was genuine Bach, that Bach’s piece was composed by Larson, and that Larson’s piece was produced by a computer.

if you wish to obey the old adage and know thyself, you should not waste your time on philosophy, meditation or psychoanalysis, but rather you should systematically collect biometric data and allow algorithms to analyse them for you and tell you who you are and what you should do. The movement’s motto is ‘Self-knowledge through numbers’.


In all likelihood you too will make important decisions about your health in the same way as Angelina Jolie. You will undergo a genetic test, a blood test or an fMRI; an algorithm will analyse the results on the basis of enormous statistical databases; and you will then accept the algorithm’s recommendation. This is not an apocalyptic scenario. Algorithms won’t revolt and enslave us. Rather, they will be so good at making decisions for us that it would be madness not to follow their advice.


If you want to know what, pay 23andMe a mere $ 99, and they will send you a small package with a tube. You spit into the tube, seal it and mail it to Mountain View, California. There the DNA in your saliva is read, and you receive the results online. You get a list of the potential health hazards you face, and your genetic predisposition to more than ninety traits and conditions ranging from baldness to blindness. ‘Know thyself’ was never easier or cheaper.


The research concludes with the following prediction (made by the human authors of the article, not by the Facebook algorithm): ‘People might abandon their own psychological judgements and rely on computers when making important life decisions, such as choosing activities, career paths, or even romantic partners. It is possible that such data-driven decisions will improve people’s lives.’


Once Cortanas evolve from oracles to agents, they might start speaking directly with one another on their masters’ behalf. It can begin innocently enough, with my Cortana contacting your Cortana to agree on a place and time for a meeting. Next thing I know, a potential employer will tell me not to bother sending a CV, but simply allow his Cortana to grill my Cortana. Or my Cortana may be approached by the Cortana of a potential lover, and the two will compare notes to decide whether it’s a good match–completely unbeknown to their human owners.


If Kindle is upgraded with face recognition and biometric sensors, it will know how each sentence you read influenced your heart rate and blood pressure. It will know what made you laugh, what made you sad and what made you angry. Soon, books will read you while you are reading them. And whereas you quickly forget most of what you read, Amazon will never forget a thing. Such data will enable Amazon to choose books for you with uncanny precision. It will also enable Amazon to know exactly who you are, and how to turn you on and off.


The new technologies of the twenty-first century may thus reverse the humanist revolution, stripping humans of their authority, and empowering non-human algorithms instead. If you are horrified by this direction, don’t blame the computer geeks. The responsibility actually lies with the biologists. It is crucial to realise that this entire trend is fuelled more by biological insights than by computer science. It is the life sciences that concluded that organisms are algorithms.


In the twenty-first century the individual is more likely to disintegrate gently from within than to be brutally crushed from without. Today most corporations and governments pay homage to my individuality and promise to provide medicine, education and entertainment customised to my unique needs and wishes. But in order to do so, corporations and governments first need to deconstruct me into biochemical subsystems, monitor these subsystems with ubiquitous sensors and decipher their working with powerful algorithms. In the process, the individual will transpire to be nothing but a religious fantasy. Reality will be a mesh of biochemical and electronic algorithms, without clear borders, and without individual hubs.


Splitting humankind into biological castes will destroy the foundations of liberal ideology. Liberalism can coexist with socio-economic gaps. Indeed, since it favours liberty over equality, it takes such gaps for granted. However, liberalism still presupposes that all human beings have equal value and authority. From a liberal perspective, it is perfectly all right that one person is a billionaire living in a sumptuous chateau, whereas another is a poor peasant living in a straw hut. For according to liberalism, the peasant’s unique experiences are still just as valuable as the billionaire’s. That’s why liberal authors write long novels about the experiences of poor peasants–and why even billionaires avidly read such books. If you go to see Les Misérables on Broadway or at Covent Garden, you will find that good seats can cost hundreds of dollars, and the audience’s combined wealth probably runs into the billions, yet they still sympathise with Jean Valjean who served nineteen years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephews.


As of early 2016, the sixty-two richest people in the world were worth as much as the poorest 3.6 billion people! Since the world’s population is about 7.2 billion, it means that these sixty-two billionaires together hold as much wealth as the entire bottom half of humankind.


Throughout history the rich have enjoyed many social and political advantages, but no huge biological gap ever separated them from the poor. Medieval aristocrats claimed that superior blue blood was flowing through their veins, and Hindu Brahmins insisted that they were naturally smarter than everyone else, but this was pure fiction. In the future, however, we may see real gaps in physical and cognitive abilities opening between an upgraded upper class and the rest of society. When scientists are confronted with this scenario, their standard reply is that in the twentieth century too many medical breakthroughs began with the rich, but eventually benefited the entire population and helped to narrow rather than widen the social gaps. For example, vaccines and antibiotics at first profited mainly the upper classes in Western countries, but today they improve the lives of all humans everywhere. However, the expectation that this process will be repeated in the twenty-first century may be just wishful thinking, for two important reasons. First, medicine is undergoing a tremendous conceptual revolution. Twentieth-century medicine aimed to heal the sick. Twenty-first-century medicine is increasingly aiming to upgrade the healthy. Healing the sick was an egalitarian project, because it assumed that there is a normative standard of physical and mental health that everyone can and should enjoy. If someone fell below the norm, it was the job of doctors to fix the problem and help him or her ‘be like everyone’. In contrast, upgrading the healthy is an elitist project, because it rejects the idea of a universal standard applicable to all and seeks to give some individuals an edge over others. People want superior memories, above-average intelligence and first-class sexual abilities. If some form of upgrade becomes so cheap and common that everyone enjoys it, it will simply be considered the new baseline, which the next generation of treatments will strive to surpass.


you tell a poor American in a Detroit slum that he has access to much better healthcare than his great-grandparents did a century ago, it is unlikely to cheer him up. Indeed, such talk will sound terribly smug and condescending. ‘Why should I compare myself to nineteenth-century factory workers or peasants?’ he would retort. ‘I want to live like the rich people on television, or at least like the folks in the affluent suburbs.’


Twentieth-century armies needed millions of healthy soldiers, and economies needed millions of healthy workers. Consequently states established public health services to ensure the health and vigour of everyone. Our greatest medical achievements were the provision of mass-hygiene facilities, the campaigns of mass vaccinations and the eradication of mass epidemics.


What would the Indian, Brazilian or Nigerian elites prefer to do in the coming century? Invest in fixing the problems of hundreds of millions of poor, or in upgrading a few million rich? Unlike in the twentieth century, when the elite had a stake in fixing the problems of the poor because they were militarily and economically vital, in the twenty-first century the most efficient (albeit ruthless) strategy might be to let go of the useless third-class carriages, and dash forward with the first class only. In order to compete with Japan, Brazil might need a handful of upgraded superhumans far more than millions of healthy ordinary workers.

'Rig-veda', or 'praise-knowledge'.


'Rig-veda', or 'praise-knowledge'. Other collections came into being, based on this sacred material, and they were given parallel names. The editors of the 'Sāma-veda' arranged the poems differently, for the purpose of chanting, and introduced numerous alternative readings to the text. The sacrificial formulae used by the priests during their recitations, together with descriptions of their ritual practices, were incorporated into collections to which the general name 'Yajur-veda' was given. Later still, a body of popular spells was combined with passages from the Rigveda, again with variant readings, and was given the name 'Atharva-veda'.

We have to recognize how unusual Akbar’s policies were for the time. The Inquisitions were in full swing and Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in1600 even as Akbar was making his pronouncements on religious tolerance in India. Not only did Akbar insist that the duty of the state included making sure that ‘no man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and any one was to be allowed to go over to any religion he pleased’,13 he also arranged systematic dialogues in his capital city of Agra between Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Parsees, Jews and others, even including agnostics and atheists.


the secular constitution that India adopted in1949, after independence from British rule, has many features already championed by Akbar in the1590s.


Akbar insisted that we should be free to examine whether reason does or does not support any existing custom, or provides justification for ongoing policy; for example, he abolished all special taxes on non-Muslims on the ground that they were discriminatory since they did not treat all citizens as equal.


Akbar insisted that we should be free to examine whether reason does or does not support any existing custom, or provides justification for ongoing policy; for example, he abolished all special taxes on non-Muslims on the ground that they were discriminatory since they did not treat all citizens as equal. In1582 he resolved to release ‘all the Imperial slaves’, since ‘it is beyond the realm of justice and good conduct’ to benefit from ‘force’.


Akbar told his friend and trusted lieutenant, Abul Fazl (a formidable scholar in Sanskrit as well as Arabic and Persian): ‘The pursuit of reason and rejection of traditionalism are so brilliantly patent as to be above the need of argument.’16 He concluded that the ‘path of reason’ or ‘the rule of the intellect’ (rahi aql) must be the basic determinant of good and just behaviour as well as of an acceptable framework of legal duties and entitlements.*


## Introducing Time (Introducing...), Craig Callender


Looking at the stars with the naked eye, an ancient astronomer could tell the time to within fifteen minutes.


The cicada is a remarkable chirping insect that remains underground for 17 years. Then 17 years after going underground, thousands of them emerge at the same time, climb the trees, mate and then die a few hours later, whereupon the 17-year cycle begins again.


The NIST F-1 (with a similar clock in Paris) is the most accurate clock in the world today. With a pool of atomic clocks around the globe, it is used to help define Coordinated Universal Time, which in turn helps define the speed of light, the length of the standard metre, and so on. But even this incredibly accurate clock will “lose” nearly a full second every 20 million years. Nothing is perfect!


## Ten "Wrongs" Can't Make A "Right", Daniel Greenberg


fallacy: Teaching does not necessarily, or even usually, lead to learning. In order to learn something, one has to be willing and eager to absorb it, to make it part of one’s store of knowledge.


Russell Ackoff was wont to say: in a standard educational setting, the only person who learns is the teacher, who is always motivated to understand the material s/he is called on to explain.


Teacher training has it all backwards. Its main focus is on trying to show prospective teachers how to get students to learn stuff they don’t want to learn—an activity called “pedagogy”.


While we’re on the topic of “subjects”, it is worth noting that the present general division of human knowledge into “subjects”—math, logic, physics, biology, rhetoric, etc.—was first made by students at Aristotle’s “Walk-around School” (a.k.a. “The Peripatetic School”) some 2400 years ago. Some of them took notes and, to organize those notes and the ideas they had absorbed from their conversations, they labeled them with names that later became memorialized as “subject areas”.


fallacy: Just ask yourself a simple question: when you think about a problem—any problem—do you first say to yourself, “What subject area does this problem fall into?”, or do you search for anything you know that can help you solve the problem? In real life, “subjects” are a useless detour on the path to wisdom.


fallacy: Over 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, a careful and thoughtful observer, proclaimed that the key feature of the world around him could be summarized in a simple phrase: “All Is Change”. It is a refrain heard more frequently than any other nowadays. Change in every walk of life is accelerating at a dizzying pace, and no one can predict what will be important and relevant when the child of today becomes the adult of tomorrow.

## This Craft of Verse, -  Jorge Luis Borges


Thomas De Quincey wrote—in some of the thousands of pages of his fourteen volumes—that to discover a new problem was quite as important as discovering the solution to an old one.

Bishop Berkeley (who, may I remind you, was a prophet of the greatness of America), I remember he wrote that the taste of the apple is neither in the apple itself—the apple cannot taste itself—nor in the mouth of the eater. It requires a contact between them.


Bishop Berkeley (who, may I remind you, was a prophet of the greatness of America), I remember he wrote that the taste of the apple is neither in the apple itself—the apple cannot taste itself—nor in the mouth of the eater. It requires a contact between them. The same thing happens to a book or to a collection of books, to a library. For what is a book in itself? A book is a physical object in a world of physical objects. It is a set of dead symbols. And then the right reader comes along, and the words—or rather the poetry behind the words, for the words themselves are mere symbols—spring to life, and we have a resurrection of the word. I


It is a fact, indeed, that most of the great teachers of mankind have been not writers but speakers. Think of Pythagoras, Christ, Socrates, the Buddha, and so on.

And some of those dialogues come to no conclusion whatever, because Plato was thinking as he wrote them; he did not know the last page when he wrote the ~rst. He was letting his mind wander, and he was dramatizing that mind into many people. I suppose his chief aim was the illusion that, despite the fact that Socrates had drunk the hemlock, Socrates was still with him. I feel this to be true because I have had many masters in my life. I am proud to be a disciple—a good disciple, I hope.


Bernard Shaw (to whom I am always going back) was asked once whether he really thought the Bible was the work of the Holy Ghost. And he said, “I think the Holy Ghost has written not only the Bible, but all books.”


we have in English the verb “to tease”—a mischievous word. It means a kind of joke. Yet in Old English tesan meant “to wound with a sword,” even as in French navrer meant “to thrust a sword through somebody.” Then, to take a different Old English word, þreat, you may ~nd out from the very ~rst verses of Beowulf that it meant “an angry crowd”—that is to say, the cause of the “threat.” And thus we might go on endlessly.

there were really two stories: the homecoming of Ulysses, and the marvels and perils of the sea.

It might be said that for many centuries, those three stories—the tale of Troy, the tale of Ulysses, the tale of Jesus—have been suf~cient for mankind.

People have told them many times over, yet the stories are still there, illimitable.

If we think of the novel and the epic, we are tempted to fall into thinking that the chief difference lies in the difference between verse and prose, in the difference between singing something and stating something. But I think there is a greater difference. The difference lies in the fact that the important thing about the epic is a hero—a man who is a pattern for all men. While, as Mencken pointed out, the essence of most novels lies in the breaking down of a man, in the degeneration of character.

Nowadays when people talk of a happy ending, they think of it as a mere pandering to the public, or they think it is a commercial device; they think of it as arti~cial. Yet for centuries men could very sincerely believe in happiness and in victory, though they felt the essential dignity of defeat.

We do not know thousands of circumstances about them, but we know them intimately. That, of course, is far more important.

I do not think that in India people have the historical sense. One of the thorns in the _esh of Europeans who write or have written histories of Indian philosophy is that all philosophy is seen as contemporary by the Indians. That is to say, they are interested in the problems themselves, not in the mere biographical fact or historical, chronological fact. That So-and-So was What’s-His-Name’s master, that he came before, that he wrote under that in_uence—all those things are nothing to them. They care about the riddle of the universe. I suppose, in a time to come (and I hope this time is around the corner), men will care for beauty, not for the circumstances of beauty. Then we will have translations not only as good (we have them already) but as famous as Chapman’s Homer, as Urquhart’s Rabelais, as Pope’s Odyssey.13 I think this is a consummation devoutly to be wished.

Let us consider a word such as “dreary”: the word “dreary” meant “bloodstained.” Similarly, the word “glad” meant “polished,” and the word “threat” meant “a threatening crowd.” Those words that now are abstract once had a strong meaning.

I have suspected many a time that meaning is really something added to verse. I know for a fact that we feel the beauty of a poem before we even begin to think of a meaning.


There are, of course, verses that are beautiful and meaningless. Yet they still have a meaning—not to the reason but to the imagination.

I have had the luck to possess many admirable friends, and there are many anecdotes told of them. Some of those anecdotes have—I am sorry to say, I am proud to say—been coined by myself. But they are not false; they are essentially true. De Quincey said that all anecdotes are apocryphal. I think that had he cared to go deeper into the matter, he would have said that they are historically apocryphal but essentially true. If a story is told of a man, then that story resembles him; that story is his symbol.

When I think of such dear friends of mine as Don Quixote, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Huckleberry Finn, Peer Gynt, and so on (I’m not sure I have many more friends), I feel that the men who wrote their histories were drawing the longbow,20 but that the adventures they evolved were mirrors or adjectives or attributes of those men. That is to say, if we believe in Mr. Sherlock Holmes, then we may look with derision on the hound of the Baskervilles; we need not fear him. So I say that what is important is our believing in a character.

Besides, we are modern by the very simple fact that we live in the present.

(mere fact is a web of circumstances and accidents),


If I say to myself, for example, that Wordsworth and Verlaine were very good nineteenth-century poets, then I may fall into the danger of thinking that time has somehow destroyed them, that they are not as good now as they were. I think the ancient idea—that we might allow perfection to art without taking into account the dates—was a braver one.


I have read several histories of Indian philosophy. The authors (Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, Americans, and so on) always wonder at the fact that in India people have no historical sense—that they treat all thinkers as if they were contemporary. They translate the words of ancient philosophy into the modern jargon of today’s philosophy. But this stands for something brave. This stands for the idea that one believes in philosophy or that one believes in poetry—that things beautiful once can go on being beautiful still.

The most expensive thing you can buy in the most densely populated places on the planet is distance.”

## The Courage To Be Disliked: How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness (Courage To series), Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga


It’s true that one often hears parents today using the phrase, ‘It’s for your own good.’ But they are clearly doing so in order to fulfil their own goals, which could be their appearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not ‘for your own good’, but for the parents’. And it is because the child senses this deception that he rebels.


One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend the non-interference approach. Non-interference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child’s task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.


If you are leading a life of worry and suffering—which stems from interpersonal relationships—first, learn the boundary of ‘from here on, that is not my task’. And discard other people’s tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the load and making life simpler.


He was a Macedonian king, who lived in the fourth century before Christ. When he was advancing on the Persian kingdom of Lydia, he learned of a chariot enshrined in the acropolis. The chariot had been secured tightly to a pillar in the temple by Gordias, the former king, and there was a local legend that said, ‘He who unravels this knot shall be master of Asia.’ It was a tightly wound knot that many men of skill had been certain they could unbind, but no one had succeeded. Now, what do you think Alexander the Great did when he stood before this knot? YOUTH: Well, didn’t he unravel the legendary knot with ease, and go on to become the ruler of Asia? PHILOSOPHER: No, that’s not how it happened. As soon as Alexander the Great saw how tight the knot was, he pulled out his sword and sliced it in half with one stroke. YOUTH: Wow! PHILOSOPHER: Then, it is said that he declared, ‘Destiny is not something brought about by legend, but by clearing away with one’s own sword.’ He had no use for the power of legend, and would forge his destiny with his sword. As you know, he then proceeded to become the great conqueror of all the territories of what is now the Middle East and western Asia. This is the famous anecdote known as the Gordian knot. And so, such intricate knots—the bonds in our interpersonal relationships—are not to be unravelled by conventional methods, but must be severed by some completely new approach. Whenever I explain the separation of tasks, I always remember the Gordian knot. YOUTH: Well, I don’t mean to contradict you, but not everyone can become Alexander the Great. Isn’t it precisely because there was no one else who could have cut the knot that the anecdote portraying it as a heroic deed is still conveyed to this day? It’s exactly the same with the separation of tasks. Even though one knows one can just cut through something with one’s sword, one might find it rather difficult. Because when one presses forward with the separation of tasks, in the end one will have to cut ties with people.


When the distance gets too small and people become stuck together, it becomes impossible to even speak to each other. But the distance must not be too great, either. Parents who scold their children too much become mentally very distant. When this happens, the child can no longer even consult the parents, and the parents can no longer give the proper assistance.


As Adler says, ‘Children who have not been taught to confront challenges will try to avoid all challenges.’

Let’s call “Reductionists” those people who prefer to build on old ideas, and “Novelists” the ones who like to champion new hypotheses. Reductionists are usually right—at least at science’s cautious core, where novelties rarely survive for long. Outside that realm, though, novelists reign, since older ideas have had more time to show their flaws.


We say “gestalt” when things combine to act in ways we can’t explain, “holistic” when we’re caught off guard by unexpected happenings and realize we understand less than we thought we did.

If the builders of a great and flourishing ancient civilization could somehow return now to see archaeologists unearthing the trivial remnants of what they had once accomplished with such effort—see the fragments of pots and vases, a few broken statues, and such tokens of another age and greatness—they could indeed ask themselves what the point of it all was, if this is all it finally came to. Yet, it did not seem so to them then, for it was just the building, and not what was finally built, that gave their life meaning. Similarly, if the builders of the ruined home and farm that I described a short while ago could be brought back to see what is left, they would have the same feelings. What we construct in our imaginations as we look over these decayed and rusting pieces would reconstruct itself in their very memories, and certainly with unspeakable sadness. The piece of a sled at our feet would revive in them a warm Christmas.

Vata, Pitta and Kapha are effectively Air, Fire and Water respectively. Vata, which is the principle of kinetic energy in the body, is mainly concerned with the nervous system, and controls all body movement. Kapha, the principle of potential energy, controls body stability and lubrication. The tissues and wastes of the body, which Vata moves around, are Kapha’s province. Pitta controls the body’s balance of kinetic and potential energies. All of Pitta’s processes involve digestion or “cooking,” even if it is the cooking of thoughts into theories in the mind. The enzymatic and endocrine systems are Pitta’s main field of activity.


These three are forces, not substances. Kapha is not mucus; it is the force which when projected into the body causes mucus to arise. Pitta is not bile; it is the force that causes bile to be produced. Vata is not gas, but increased Vata increases gas. Vata, Pitta and Kapha are called doshas because the word dosha means “a thing that can go out of whack.”

Emerson said that a library is a magic chamber in which there are many enchanted spirits. They wake when we call them. When the book lies unopened, it is literally, geometrically, a volume, a thing among things. When we open it, when the book surrenders itself to its reader, the aesthetic event occurs. And even for the same reader the same book changes, for we change; we are the river of Heraclitus, who said that the man of yesterday is not the man of today, who will not be the man of tomorrow. We change incessantly, and each reading of a book, each rereading, each memory of that rereading, reinvents the text.

Alexander rebuked him, saying that now everyone could know what was previously known only to the elect. Aristotle responded in his own defense, no doubt with sincerity: “My treatise has been published and not published.” He did not believe that a book expounded a subject completely, but rather that it served as a sort of guide to accompany oral instruction.


Rudolf Steiner, in his books on anthroposophy, which was the name he gave to his theosophy. He said that when something ends, we must think that something begins. His advice is salutory, but the execution is difficult, for we only know what we have lost, not what we will gain. We have a very precise image an image at times shameless of what we have lost, but we are ignorant of what may follow or replace it.

writer, or any man, must believe that whatever happens to him is an instrument; everything has been given for an end. This is even stronger in the case of the artist. Everything that happens, including humiliations, embarrassments, misfortunes, all has been given like clay, like material for one's art. One must accept it.

## Diabetes Unpacked: Just Science and Sense. No Sugar Coating, Tim Noakes


Anyway, with regard to the drugs used to treat diabetes, we have metformin – the most commonly used. This helps to reduce release/formation of glucose, from glycogen, from the liver (gluconeogenesis), and increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. We also have sulphonylureas, there are many of these, which flog the beta-cells to produce more insulin. We have pioglitazone, which is supposed to increase insulin sensitivity in muscle and does something beneficial in the liver. We have acarbose, which stops the body digesting carbohydrates (which are all turned to sugar in the gut). We have other new drugs that increase hormones produced in the gut which stimulate insulin production after eating – in various ways. The most recent drugs are those that prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar, so more sugar is lost in the urine. Hmmmm. As you can see these are all focussed on insulin, and sugar, and nothing much else. Finally, of course, we have insulin itself. More and more people with T2DM are put on insulin to keep the blood sugar down. Of course, people are also told to lose weight and exercise more. People have been told to do this for the last forty years. Obesity and diabetes have both exploded in the past forty years. So this advice has been splendidly effective.


And what substance raises insulin levels more than any other? The answer is carbohydrates. Thus, if you eat a high carbohydrate diet, you will store fat quickly and efficiently. You will become obese, insulin resistant and, eventually diabetic. If you are already diabetic and you eat a high carbohydrate diet, you will become more obese, more insulin resistant. and more


Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity and cancers all involve chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and free radical formation. But these factors do not cause the disease; they only indicate the presence of the disease.


Some is stored as glycogen in the liver, but the amount that can be stored this way is limited. Insulin converts the excess carbohydrate via DNL to fatty acids, which are packaged with glycerol to form triglycerides, the storage form of fat.


At its very core, T2DM can be understood as too much glucose and too much insulin. The solution becomes immediately obvious. We must lower the insulin and lower the glucose. The sugar is not just in the blood. That’s only part of the problem. There’s too much sugar in our entire body.


prescribes a medication such as insulin. But insulin does not rid the body of that excess sugar. Instead, it simply takes the blood sugar and rams it back into the liver. The liver doesn’t want it either, so it ships it out to all the other organs – the kidneys, the nerves, the eyes, and the heart. Much of this extra sugar will also just get turned into fat.


The blood sugars got better with insulin, but the diabetes got worse. This unfortunately happens to virtually every patient. The higher dose of medications only hides the blood sugar by cramming it into the engorged body. The diabetes looks better, but actually is getting worse. Doctors


The End Game What happens over ten or twenty years? Every single part of the body just starts to rot. This is precisely why T2DM, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every single part of the body. Every organ suffers the long-term effects of the excessive sugar load. Your eyes rot – and you go blind.


The End Game What happens over ten or twenty years? Every single part of the body just starts to rot. This is precisely why T2DM, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every single part of the body. Every organ suffers the long-term effects of the excessive sugar load. Your eyes rot – and you go blind. Your kidneys rot – and you need dialysis. You heart rots – and you get heart attacks and heart failure. Your brain rots – and you get Alzheimer’s disease. Your liver rots – and you get fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. Your legs rot – and you get diabetic foot ulcers. Your nerves rot – and you get diabetic neuropathy. No part of your body is spared.


There are really only two ways to get rid of the excessive sugar in the body. Don’t put sugar in. Burn it off.


Instead focus on eating lots of vegetables and natural healthy fats.


Natural fats, such as found in avocado, nuts and olive oil are well known to have healthy effects on both heart disease and diabetes.


Dietary cholesterol has also been shown to have no harmful effect on the human body. Eggs and butter are excellent sources of natural fats, which have minimal effect on blood glucose or insulin.


Low refined carbohydrates, moderate protein and high natural fats.


Fasting is the simplest and surest method to force your body to burn sugar.


T2DM is merely excessive glucose in the body, so burning it off will reverse the disease.


T2DM is simply the result of chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption beyond the genetically predetermined maximum carbohydrate handling capacity of the insulin-glucagon hormonal system.


No medication cures T2DM because medications do not treat the cause of T2DM. Medications only slow down the progression of the disease, merely altering the handling of sugar that is already in the system.


In the spectrum of what we have mislabeled as “food”, exclusively carbohydrates are highly addictive2 and in excess directly or indirectly cause a variety of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) including T2DM and obesity.


Under the control of the hunger-satiety system, it is virtually impossible to overeat essential foods, become unhealthily obese or develop any of the dietary CNCDs such as T2DM


No essential nutrient activates the endorphin pathway. Under the control of the hunger-satiety system, it is virtually impossible to overeat essential foods, become unhealthily obese or develop any of the dietary CNCDs such as T2DM


Carbohydrates, however, are not essential nutrients but powerful endorphin-activating drugs that are not controlled by the genetic hunger-satiety feedback system. At a very early age, the trigger for carbohydrate consumption is hunger or thirst, as part of the genetically-controlled hunger-thirst-satiety feedback system.


You cannot have T2DM if you do not consume carbohydrates. And just as with alcohol, opioids and nicotine, it matters not how the drug enters your face – whether as a simple sugar or as a complex starch, nor how fast it enters.


Any substance with a significant total carbohydrate load is toxic to a diabetic irrespective of the glycemic index or the nutritional additives or the label advertisement.


Treating the glucose level after the sugar has already entered the bloodstream with exercise or expensive medications may slow down progression of the end-organ damage, but does not affect the disease process.


The human brain can only focus intensely for about 20 minutes at any one time; then it needs a short break to recalibrate.


Vulnerability to addiction primarily occurs in two populations – people with authoritarian personalities and people with permissive or hedonistic personalities.


We can measure the strain that chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption puts on the pancreas by measuring fasting C-peptide and insulin levels (variably called prediabetes or insulin resistance). Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels tell us when a patient is becoming “diabetic” i.e. their insulin-producing capacity can no longer keep pace with carbohydrate consumption and the pancreas loses the ability to maintain the glucose-insulin clamp and blood glucose rises into harmful territory.


Generally, the fatter a person is (another toxic consequence of chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption), the less likely they are to be diabetic because insulin drives sugar conversion to fat, but eventually everyone’s pancreas will fail, weight gain slows, but T2DM ensues.


However, by definition, by the time T2DM is measurable, the diabetic has lost control of their relationship with carbohydrates, and has become a carbohydrate addict.


So, from a nutritional perspective, vegetables are free to eat, but not after “juicing” which is a method of extracting the drug from the food. After a rough stressful day, no person is reaching into the fridge for broccoli to soothe their mental anguish.


Both patients and physicians need to be very aware that blood glucose levels may normalise very rapidly. If the patient abstains from carbohydrates, but continues to take their diabetic medication, they may induce hypoglycemia.


In our experience, most Type 2 diabetics are able to come off their medication with normal blood glucose levels (our definition of remission) within 2-4 weeks of starting the protocol.


Diabetogenesis is the toxicity mediated by chronic excessive carbohydrate consumption irrespective of whether the blood glucose numbers meet a treatment threshold.

## The Black Swan the Impact of the Highly Improbable, Nassim Nicholas Taleb


History is opaque. You see what comes out, not the script that produces events, the generator of history. There is a fundamental incompleteness in your grasp of such events, since you do not see what’s inside the box, how the mechanisms work. What I call the generator of historical events is different from the events themselves, much as the minds of the gods cannot be read just by witnessing their deeds. You are very likely to be fooled about their intentions.

## A Pedagogy for Liberation Dialogues on Transforming Education by Paulo Freire, Ira Shor (auth.) (z-lib.org), vkv.foe@gmail.com


I never, never could understand the process of motivation outside of practice, before practice. It is as if first I needed to be motivated and then I could get into action! Do you see? That is a very anti-dialectical way of understanding motivation. Motivation takes part in the action.


First learn the skills, and then you can get a real education! First get a real education and then you can get a good job! The best thing is always the thing you are not doing. No wonder students are non-cooperative.


The official pedagogy is motivating students against intellectual work. This power struggle in curriculum has led to a stalemate in schools and colleges, which various official bodies have mis-defined as student 'mediocrity.' I call it a 'performance strike' by students who refuse to study under current social conditions.


When students want something badly, they move heaven and earth to get it.


say that reading is not just to walk on the words, and it is not flying over the words either. Reading is re-writing what we are reading. Reading is to discover the connections between the text and the context of the text, and also how to connect the text/context with my context, the context of the reader. And what happens is that many times we read authors who died one hundred years ago and we know nothing about his or her time. And often we know very little about our own time!


The official curriculum asks them to submit to texts, lectures, and tests, to habituate them to submitting to authority. Students are very good at resisting the demands of authority, but they can also reject the nontraditional classroom. Some do it with silent disregard; some actively resist; some are simply out to lunch. The problem is to ease a transition gradually away from the old habits.

Quantum theory has clarified the foundations of chemistry, the functioning of atoms, of solids, of plasmas, of the color of the sky, the dynamics of the stars, the origins of galaxies . . . a thousand aspects of the world. It is at the basis of the latest technologies: from computers to nuclear power.


the electrons in atoms orbited around the nucleus only on certain precise orbits, at certain precise distances from the nucleus, with certain precise energies—before magically “leaping” from one orbit to another.


What we observe of an electron in an atom is the light emitted when, according to Bohr’s hypothesis, it leaps from one orbit to another. A leap involves two orbits: the one the electron leaves and the one it leaps to. Each observation can then be placed, as I have mentioned, in the entries of a table where the orbit of departure determines the row; the orbit of arrival, the column. Heisenberg’s idea is to write all the quantities which describe the movement of the electron—position, velocity, energy—no longer as numbers, but as tables of numbers. Instead of having a single position x for the electron, we have an entire table of possible positions X: one for every possible leap. The idea is to continue to use the same equations as always, simply replacing the usual quantities (position, velocity, energy and frequency of orbit and so on) with such tables.


Heisenberg immediately sees that the conceptual clarity of Schrödinger’s waves is a mirage. Sooner or later a wave spreads out and is spatially diffused; an electron does not: when it arrives from somewhere, it always arrives complete in a single point.


What Born understands is that the value of Schrödinger’s ψ wave at a point in space is related to the probability of observing the electron at this point.24 If an atom emits an electron and is surrounded by particle detectors, the value of ψ where there is a detector determines the probability of that detector, and not another, detecting the electron. Schrödinger’s ψ is therefore not a representation of a real entity: it is an instrument of calculation that gives the probability that something real will occur. It is like the weather forecasts telling us what could happen tomorrow. The same—it soon


Inside an oven, for example, electromagnetic waves behave in a curious way. The heat (that is, the energy) is not distributed among all frequencies, as we would naturally expect: it never reaches higher frequencies. In 1900, twenty-five years before Heisenberg’s journey to Helgoland, the German physicist Max Planck had discovered a formula that reproduced well the way that the energy of heat, measured in a laboratory, distributed among waves of different frequency.27 He derived this formula from general rules, but added a curious hypothesis: the energy could be transmitted to the waves only in integer multiples of elementary energies. In discrete packets. The dimensions of these packets, in order to make Planck’s calculation work, must be different for waves of different frequency: they must be proportional to the frequency.28 High-frequency waves can only receive more energetic packets. Energy does not reach the very high frequencies because there is not enough of it to transmit big enough packets.


Today we often use the symbol ħ, which stands for h divided by 2π. Dirac developed the habit of placing a small line through the h, because in calculations h is frequently divided by 2π, and he got tired of writing “h/2π” every time. The symbol ħ is called “h bar.” It has come to be called “Planck’s constant,” just


Einstein suggests that light and all the other electromagnetic waves are actually made up of elementary grains.29 These are the first “quanta.” Today we call them “photons,” the quanta of light. Planck’s constant h measures their size: every photon has an energy h times the frequency of the light of which it is part.


Planck’s constant h measures their size: every photon has an energy h times the frequency of the light of which it is part.


the theory doesn’t tell us where to find any one particle of matter when we are not looking at it. It only speaks about the probability of finding it at one point if we observe it.


“quantum superposition.” A quantum superposition is when two contradictory properties are, in a certain sense, present together. An object could be here but at the same time elsewhere. It is what Heisenberg means by saying that “the electron no longer has a trajectory”: the electron is found not to be only in one place or another. In a sense it is in both places.


This is quantum superposition: the photon is, so to say, “on both paths.” But if you search for it, it is only on one path.


For as Niels Bohr once said, you should “never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think.”


QBism abandons a realistic image of the world, beyond what we can see or measure. The theory gives us the probability that we will see something, and this is all that it is legitimate to say. It is not legitimate to say anything about the cat or the photon when we are not actually observing them.


central question raised by Heisenberg—what


central question raised by Heisenberg—what is an observation? what is an observer?—finally


Reality is a luxuriant stratification: snow-covered mountains and forests, the smiles of friends, the rumble of the subway on dirty winter mornings, our insatiable thirst, the dance of our fingers across a laptop keyboard, the taste of bread, the sorrow of the world, the night sky, the immensity of the stars, Venus shining alone in the ultramarine blue of twilight . . . Behind this disordered veil of appearances, we thought we had found the deep weave, the hidden order. This was the time in which things seemed simple. But the great hopes of the insignificant mortal critters that we are too often turn out to be short-lived dreams. The conceptual clarity of classical physics has been swept away by quanta. Reality is decidedly not how it is described by classical physics.


Not to fear rethinking the world is the power of science: ever since Anaximander removed the foundations on which the Earth rested, Copernicus launched it to rotate in the sky, Einstein dissolved the rigidity of space and of time, and Darwin demolished the separateness of humanity . . . reality is constantly being redrawn in images that are increasingly effective.


What quantum theory describes, then, is the way in which one part of nature manifests itself to any other single part of nature.


The world that we observe is continuously interacting. It is a dense web of interactions.


Individual objects are the way in which they interact. If there was an object that had no interactions, no effect upon anything, emitted no light, attracted nothing and repelled nothing, was not touched and had no smell . . . it would be as good as nonexistent.


Bohr speaks of the “impossibility of neatly separating the behavior of atomic systems from their interaction with the measuring device used to define the conditions under which the phenomenon appears.”


This is the significance of Heisenberg’s original intuition: to ask what the orbit of an electron is when it is not interacting with anything is an empty question. The electron does not follow an orbit because its physical properties are only those that determine how it affects something else, for instance, the light that it emits when it is interacting. If the electron is not interacting, there are no properties.


Facts that are real with respect to an object are not necessarily so with respect to another.* A property may be real with respect to a stone, and not real with respect to another stone.55


The discovery of quantum theory is only slightly more radical: it is the discovery that all the properties (variables) of all objects are relational, just as in the case of speed.


The discovery of quantum theory is only slightly more radical: it is the discovery that all the properties (variables) of all objects are relational, just as in the case of speed. Physical variables do not describe things: they describe the way in which things manifest themselves to each other.


Cosmological Koans, Anthony Aguirre describes this disconcerting conclusion in the following way: An electron is a particular type of regularity that appears among measurements and observations that we make. It is more pattern than a substance. It is order . . . Thus we arrive at a strange place. We break things down into smaller and smaller pieces, but then the pieces, when examined, are not there. Just the arrangements of them are. What then, are things, like the boat, or its sails, or your fingernails? What are they? If things are forms of forms of forms of forms, and if forms are order, and order is defined by us . . . they exist, it would appear, only as created by, and in relation to, us and the Universe. They are, the Buddha might say, emptiness.


This can be summarized in two general facts that radically differentiate quantum physics from classical physics, encapsulating the novelty of the quanta:69 The maximal amount of relevant information about an object70 is finite. It is always possible to acquire new relevant information about any object. These two facts are so basic that they are called “postulates.” At first glance the two postulates appear to contradict each other. If the information is finite, how is it always possible to obtain more of it? The contradiction is only apparent, however, because the postulates refer to “relevant” information. Relevant information is that which counts for predicting the future behavior of the object. When we acquire new information, part of the old information becomes “irrelevant”: that is to say, it does not change what can be said about the future.


If we could know with infinite precision all the physical variables that describe a thing, we would have infinite information. But this is impossible. The limit is determined by the Planck constant ħ.73 This is the meaning of Planck’s constant. It is the limit up to which we can determine physical variables.


“Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.” It applies to everything.


“Noncommutative” means: such that their order cannot be changed freely.


But at the molecular scale, the cutting edge of a sharp knife is as fluctuating and imprecise as the edge of an ocean in a storm, fraying upon the white sand of its shore.


The well-defined and solid picture of the world given by the old physics is an illusion. On April 18, 1947, on the sacred island of Helgoland, the Royal Navy blows up three thousand nine hundred ninety-seven tons of dynamite—what was left of munitions abandoned there by the German army.


Ernst Mach.85 In short, Mach stands at a remarkable crossroads of science, politics, philosophy and literature. And some people still view the natural sciences, humanities and literature as unconnected!

When Einstein objected to quantum mechanics by remarking that “God does not play dice,” Bohr responded by admonishing him, “Stop telling God what to do.” Which means: Nature is richer than our metaphysical prejudices. It has more imagination than we do.


We must take seriously the new things we learn about the world, even if they clash with our preconceptions about how reality is constituted.


The central point is simpler: the properties of an object become manifest when this object interacts with others.


The technical term used by Nāgārjuna to describe the absence of independent existence is “emptiness” (śūnyatā): things are “empty” in the sense of having no autonomous existence.


I believe that one of the greatest mistakes made by human beings is to want certainties when trying to understand something. The search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty: it is nourished by a radical absence of certainty. Thanks to the acute awareness of our ignorance, we are open to doubt and can continue to learn and to learn better.

Most of these structures quickly perish, with the exception of those having the characteristics to survive: these are the living organisms.


Aristotle objects that we invariably see calves born “well structured”: we do not see every possible variety of shape brought forth, with only the most adequate surviving.123 But today it has become clear that Empedocles’s idea, transferred from individuals to species and enriched by what we have learned about heredity and genetics, is

The principal means of this stability are the molecules of DNA, which remain more or less similar to their ancestors. This implies that there are correlations, that is to say relative information, across eons of time. The molecules of DNA codify and transmit information. This informational stability is perhaps the most characteristic aspect of living matter.


But quantum physics is the discovery that the physical world is a web of correlations: relative information. The things of nature are not collections of isolated elements in haughty individualism.


Ὁ κόσμος άλλοίωσις, ὁ βίος ὑπόληψις. The cosmos is change, life is discourse—as the fragment 115 by Democritus has it. The cosmos is interaction; life organizes relative information.


Every cell is a city, every protein a castle of atoms; in each atomic nucleus an inferno of quantum dynamics is stirring, quarks and gluons swirl, excitations of quantum fields.


Every cell is a city, every protein a castle of atoms; in each atomic nucleus an inferno of quantum dynamics is stirring, quarks and gluons swirl, excitations of quantum fields. This is only a small wood on a small planet that revolves around a little star, among one hundred billion stars in one of the thousand billion galaxies constellated with dazzling cosmic events.


One of the most fascinating recent developments in neuroscience concerns the functioning of our visual system. How do we see? How do we know that what we have in front of us is a book, or a cat? It would seem natural to think that receptors detect the light that reaches the retinas of our eyes and transform it into signals that race to the interior of the brain, where groups of neurons elaborate the information in ever more complex ways, until they interpret it and identify the objects in question. Neurons recognize lines that separate colors, other neurons recognize shapes drawn by these lines, others again check these shapes against data stored in our memory. Others still arrive at the recognition: it’s a cat. It turns out, however, that the brain does not work like this at all. It functions, in fact, in an opposite way. Many, if not most, of the signals do not travel from the eyes to the brain; they go the other way, from the brain to the eyes.132 What happens is that the brain expects to see something, on the basis of what it knows and has previously occurred. The brain elaborates an image of what it predicts the eyes should see. This information is conveyed from the brain to the eyes, through intermediate stages. If a discrepancy is revealed between what the brain expects and the light arriving into the eyes, only then do the neural circuits send signals toward the brain. So images from around us do not travel from the eyes to the brain—only news of discrepancies regarding what the brain expects do. The discovery that sight functions in this way came as a surprise. But if we think about it, it becomes clear that this is the most efficient way of retrieving information from the surroundings. What would be the point of sending signals toward the brain that do nothing but confirm what it already knows? Information technology uses similar techniques to compress files of images: instead of putting into the memory the color of all the pixels, it stores information only on where the colors change. That is less information, but enough to reconstruct the images.


Hippolyte Taine, we can say that “external perception is an internal dream which proves to be in harmony with external things; and instead of calling ‘hallucination’ a false perception, we must call external perception ‘a confirmed hallucination.’”


Prospero in the epigraph to this chapter: “And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, / The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve, / And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, / Leave not a rack behind.”


“We are such stuff / As dreams are made on, and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep.”


Every vision is partial. There is no way of seeing reality that is not dependent on a perspective—no point of view that is absolute and universal.

Growth requires genetic information plus time and energy. Development happens in steps that occur in space and time in an ordered fashion. The outcome is a system that would require more information to describe than was needed to start its growth. By contrast, most ANNs do not grow.

## Nagarjuna's Letter to a Friend, Kyabje Kangyur Rinpoche


Generosity and discipline, patience, diligence, Concentration, and the wisdom that knows thusnessThose measureless perfections, make them grow, And be a Mighty Conqueror who's crossed samsara's sea.


Men, like mangoes, can be sour and yet look ripe, Some though ripe look green, and others green Are sour indeed, while others still look ripe And ripe they are: from this know how to act.


In order that you see the absolute, Get used to truly understanding things. No other practice is there such as this Possessed of special virtues such as these.


Perform no evil, even for the sake Of brahmins, bhikshus, gods, or honored guests, Your father, mother, queen, or for your court. The ripened fruit in hell's for you alone.


Faith and ethics, learning, bounteousness, A flawless sense of shame and decency, And wisdom are the seven riches Buddha taught. Know, other common riches have no worth.


A pinch of salt can give its salty taste To a little water, but not to the Ganges stream. So know that, likewise, minor evil deeds Can never change a mighty source of good.


Men who've fathered sons in turn are sons, And mothers likewise daughters. Bitter foes Turn into friends, the converse too is true. Because of this samsara's never sure.


Lacking wisdom, concentration fails, And without concentration, wisdom too. For someone who has both, samsara's sea Fills no more than the print left by a hoof.

But most real-world systems are more apt to experience dynamic equilibrium, meaning things fluctuate within a particular range.


Kongo Gumi. A construction company specializing in high-quality Buddhist temples, it operated independently from 578 AD to 2006. Today it exists as a subsidiary of a larger company. At the time of Kongo Gumi’s liquidation, it was the oldest company in the world, having built Japan’s first-ever Buddhist temple. Throughout the entirety of that time, it remained in the hands of the same family—40 generations of them.


difference between medicine and poison is in the dose. Too much of a beneficial substance can be harmful or lethal, and a tiny amount of a harmful substance can have beneficial effects.


Our ego gets in the way of capitalizing on the margin of safety that is produced by knowing more than you need to. Often we learn enough to solve today’s problem but not enough to solve tomorrow’s. There is no margin of safety in what we know. Another way our ego gets in the way is that we tend to coast on our natural strengths, too afraid or intimidated to dive into being the worst at something. But as Hadfield explains, “Early success is a terrible teacher. You’re essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can’t do it. You don’t know how.”


Within systems, components are constantly wearing out and getting used up. This includes both the material and information (the stocks) within a system and the parts of the system itself. Keeping a system functioning requires ongoing replenishing of both the stocks and the parts used to maintain them.


Within systems, components are constantly wearing out and getting used up. This includes both the material and information (the stocks) within a system and the parts of the system itself. Keeping a system functioning requires ongoing replenishing of both the stocks and the parts used to maintain them. We call this process of attrition “churn.”


Part of what made Bourbaki such a revolutionary collective was its insistence that members churn at regular intervals. This ensured an inflow of new perspectives and knowledge.


Using the lens of churn on the story of Bourbaki demonstrates there can be value in constant change. Harnessed and directed appropriately, churn brings in new ideas and increases our adaptability. It’s what allows for evolution by selecting for beneficial traits.


« “Algorithm” is arguably the single most important concept in our world. If we want to understand our life and our future, we should make every effort to understand what an algorithm is, and how algorithms are connected with emotions. An algorithm is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems, and reach decisions. An algorithm isn’t a particular calculation, but the method followed when making the calculation. » Yuval Noah Harari 1 Algorithms


Moving beyond computers, all systems need algorithms to function: sets of instructions for adapting to and solving problems. Increasingly, algorithms are designed to be directionally correct over perfect. They often evolve—or are designed—to get useful and relevant enough outputs to keep the system functioning properly. Neither nature nor humans worry about producing algorithms that produce the most optimal outputs 100% of the time. When we look at a system, it’s useful to consider the underlying instructions dictating its behavior in order to determine how to intervene to improve it.


The pirates who survived the longest and became the richest during the heyday of piracy did so by following rigid rules underscored in many cases by something a lot like a constitution, known as articles, as Peter T. Leeson explains in The Invisible Hook. 7


Looking at how pirate leaders like Ching Shih managed to lead large numbers of pirates in high-stakes situations teaches us how algorithms can ensure cohesion within systems. For a system to produce its intended output, the goals of its parts need to be aligned in the same direction. This increases the chances of consistently achieving a predictable outcome. Controlling


Space alone does not create this environment. An overly large square can actively repel people as it feels overexposed and empty. A popular one must have enough activity and reasons to visit in a small enough space to create the density needed for spontaneous and ongoing interactions to occur.


As Aristotle put it thousands of years ago, “The whole is something over and above its parts, and not just the sum of them all.”


We cannot understand systems with emergent properties by reducing them to their components. Termite mounds exhibit emergent properties. A single termite is powerless, but a million or two working together can build a complex mound up to 17 feet tall, requiring the movement of a ton of soil and several tons of water each year. 3 Without a leader orchestrating their movements, termites build ventilation and cooling systems, storage chambers, fungal

you don’t always need to plan things all the way to the end. If you have a simple starting point on the right trajectory, surprising things can pan out through the power of emergence.


Joseph Henrich *, in The Secret of Our Success, explains that “the striking technologies that characterize our species, from the kayaks and compound bows used by hunter-gatherers to the antibiotics and airplanes of the modern world, emerge not from singular geniuses but from the flow and recombination of ideas, practices, lucky errors, and chance insights among interconnected minds and across generations.” 16 Basically humans create things as a group that no one person is capable of.


Relatively small improvements are easier than large ones, so most successful innovations will lead to small changes. These modest attempts at improvement give behaviors a nudge in an adaptive direction, on average.


## Krishnas Other Song A New Look at the Uddhava Gita by Steven J. Rosen (z-lib.org), Unknown


all conditioned souls naturally feel out of place in the material world, and they experience misery, no matter where they are—in heaven or in hell. Just as this misery comes of its own accord, so, too, will happiness occur, even without one’s seeking it. For this reason, people who are truly intelligent do not make separate endeavors for material happiness.


## My Notes, Unknown


it will help us be: Humble in our aspirations Gracious in our success Resilient in our failures


Isocrates began by informing the young man that “no adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control; for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in restraint.” “Practice self-control,” he said, warning Demonicus not to fall under the sway of “temper, pleasure, and pain.” And “abhor flatterers as you would deceivers; for both, if trusted, injure those who trust them.” He wanted him to “Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure” and “Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves” and that the “best thing which we have in ourselves is good judgment.” Constantly train your intellect, he told him, “for the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body.” March 14, 2022 29 This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable—those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of “moderation,” in the Greek sense. It is poise, not pose. March 14, 2022 32 Kierkegaard warned, “Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it.”


Sherman had a good rule he tried to observe. “Never give reasons for you what think or do until you must. Maybe, after a while, a better reason will pop into your head.”

Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs.


We don’t like thinking that someone is better than us. Or that we have a lot left to learn. We want to be done. We want to be ready. We’re busy and overburdened. For this reason, updating your appraisal of your talents in a downward direction is one of the most difficult things to do in life—but it is almost always a component of mastery. The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote

Our teachers in life are not only those we pay, as Hammett paid Satriani. Nor are they necessarily part of some training dojo, like it is for Shamrock. Many of the best teachers are free. They volunteer because, like you, they once were young and had the same goals you do. Many don’t even know they are teaching—they are simply exemplars, or even historical figures whose lessons survive in books and essays. But ego makes us so hardheaded and hostile to feedback that it drives them away or puts them beyond our reach. It’s why the old proverb says, “When student is ready, the teacher appears.”

Or a teenage girl who spends three hours in front of the mirror each morning, as if she’s about to go on stage. They do this because they’re convinced that their every move is being watched with rapt attention by the rest of the world. Even as adults, we’re susceptible to this fantasy during a harmless walk down the street. We plug in some headphones and all of a sudden there’s a soundtrack. We flip up our jacket collar and consider briefly how cool we must look. We replay the successful meeting we’re heading toward in our head. The crowds part as we pass. We’re fearless warriors, on our way to the top. It’s the opening credits montage. It’s a scene in a novel. It feels good—so much better than those feelings of doubt and fear and normalness—and so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us.

Franklin quickly illustrated just how ridiculously inflated his young ego had become. Chatting with Mather as they walked down a hallway, Mather suddenly admonished him, “Stoop! Stoop!” Too caught up in his performance, Franklin walked right into a low ceiling beam. Mather’s response was perfect: “Let this be a caution to you not always to hold your head so high,” he said wryly. “Stoop, young man, stoop—as you go through this world—and you’ll miss many hard thumps.”


Genghis Khan groomed his sons and generals to succeed him later in life, he repeatedly warned them, “If you can’t swallow your pride, you can’t lead.” He told them that pride would be harder to subdue than a wild lion. He liked the analogy of a mountain


Even the tallest mountains have animals that, when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain.”


Degas complained to his friend, the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, about his trouble writing. “I can’t manage to say what I want, and yet I’m full of ideas.” Mallarmé’s response cuts to the bone. “It’s not with ideas, my dear Degas, that one makes verse. It’s with words


philosopher and writer Paul Valéry explained in 1938, “A poet’s function . . . is not to experience the poetic state: that is a private affair. His function is to create it in others.” That is, his job is to produce work


There is another apt Latin expression: Materiam superabat opus. (The workmanship was better than the material.) The material we’ve been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that’s where we begin. We don’t control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it.


Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you’ve got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving


For ego is a wicked sister of success. And you’re about to experience what that means.


Here we are at the top of a mountain we worked hard to climb—or at least the summit is in sight. Now we face new temptations and problems. We breathe thinner air in an unforgiving environment. Why is success so ephemeral? Ego shortens it. Whether a collapse is dramatic or a slow erosion, it’s always possible and often unnecessary. We stop learning, we stop listening, and we lose our grasp on what matters. We become victims of ourselves and the competition. Sobriety, open-mindedness, organization, and purpose—these are the great stabilizers. They balance out the ego and pride that comes with achievement and recognition.


Without virtue and training, Aristotle observed, “it is hard to bear the results of good fortune suitably. April 6, 2022 96 We know that empires always fall, so we must think about why—and why they seem to always collapse from within. April 6, 2022 97 Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety. We can’t keep learning if we think we already know everything. We cannot buy into myths we make ourselves, or the noise and chatter of the outside world


Genghis Khan was not born a genius. Instead, as one biographer put it, his was “a persistent cycle of pragmatic learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his uniquely disciplined and focused will.”


He was the greatest conqueror the world ever knew because he was more open to learning than any other conqueror has ever been April 6, 2022 99


It was a habit that would survive his death. While the Mongols themselves seemed dedicated almost solely to the art of war, they put to good use every craftsman, merchant, scholar, entertainer, cook, and skilled worker they came in contact with. The Mongol Empire was remarkable for its religious freedoms, and most of all, for its love of ideas and convergence of cultures


The physicist John Wheeler, who helped develop the hydrogen bomb, once observed that “as our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.” In other words, each victory and advancement that made Khan smarter also bumped him against new situations he’d never encountered before. It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. It’s remembering Socrates’ wisdom lay in the fact that he knew that he knew next to nothing.


Peter Drucker says that it’s not enough simply to want to learn. As people progress, they must also understand how they learn and then set up processes to facilitate this continual education


It’s during your moment at the top that you can afford ego the least—because the stakes are so much higher, the margins for error are so much smaller. If anything, your ability to listen, to hear feedback, to improve and grow matter more now than ever


infamy. A great destiny, Seneca reminds us, is great slavery


The same goes for us, whatever we do. Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here. Because that’s the only thing that will keep us here.


On an individual level, however, it’s absolutely critical that you know who you’re competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you’re in.


According to Seneca, the Greek word euthymia is one we should think of often: it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it


One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important. —BERTRAND RUSSELL


He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears,” wrote Seneca


When we’re aspiring or small time, we can be idiosyncratic, we can compensate for disorganization with hard work and a little luck. That’s not going to cut it in the majors. In fact, it’ll sink you if you can’t grow up and organize.


we all face becoming the adult supervision we originally rebelled against. Yet often we react petulantly and prefer to think: Now that I’m in charge, things are going to be different!


A fish stinks from the head, is the saying. Well, you’re the head now.


Early on in our careers, we may be able to make these sacrifices more easily. We can drop out of a prestigious college to start our own company. Or we can tolerate being looked over once in a while. Once we’ve “made it,“ the tendency is to switch to the mind-set of “getting what’s mine.” Now, all of a sudden awards and recognition matter—even though they weren’t what got us here. We need that money, that title, that media attention—not for the team


The writer Cheryl Strayed once told a young reader, “You’re becoming who you are going to be and so you might as well not be an asshole.” This is one of the most dangerous ironies of success—it can make us someone we never wanted to be in the first place. The Disease of Me can corrupt the most innocent climb. April 10, 2022 127

As his wife later observed, the people who saw George Marshall as simply modest or quiet missed what was special about the man. He had the same traits that everyone has—ego, self-interest, pride, dignity, ambition—but they were “tempered by a sense of humility and selflessness.


Here’s an exercise: walk onto ancient battlefield or a place of historical significance. Look at the statues and you can’t help but see how similar the people look, how little has changed since then—since before, and how it will be forever after. Here a great man once stood. Here another brave woman died. Here a cruel rich man lived, in this palatial home . . . It’s the sense that others have been here before you, generations of them, in fact. In those moments, we have a sense of the immensity of the


The astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has described this duality well—it’s possible to bask in both your relevance and irrelevance to the cosmos. As he says, “When I look up in the universe, I know I’m small, but I’m also big. I’m big because I’m connected to the universe and the universe is connected to me.” We just can’t forget which is bigger and which has been here longer.


By widening our perspective, more comes into view. It’s sad how disconnected from the past and the future most of us really are. We forget that woolly mammoths walked the earth while the pyramids were being built. We don’t realize that Cleopatra lived closer to our time than she did to the construction of those famous pyramids that marked her kingdom. When British workers excavated the land in Trafalgar Square to build Nelson’s Column and its famous stone lions, in the ground they found the bones of actual lions


Blake poem that opens with “To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour.”


Feel unprotected against the elements or forces or surroundings. Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you. Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite, and end your conscious separation from the world. Reconcile yourself a bit better with the realities of life. Realize how much came before you, and how only wisps of it remain. Let the feeling carry you as long as you can. Then when you start to feel better or bigger than, go and do it again.


Merkel is the embodiment of Aesop’s fable about the tortoise. She is slow and steady. The historic night the Berlin Wall fell, she was thirty-five. She had one beer, went to bed, and showed up early for work the next day. A few years later, she had worked to become a respected but obscure physicist. Only then did she enter politics. In her fifties, she became chancellor. It was a diligent, plodding path. Yet the rest of us want to get to the top as fast as humanly possible. We have no patience for waiting. We’re high on getting high up the ranks. Once we’ve made it, we tend to think that ego and energy is the only way to stay there. It’s not.


The historian Shelby Foote observed that “power doesn’t so much corrupt; that’s too simple. It fragments, closes options, mesmerizes.”


Aristotle wrote. “In each case, it is hard work to find the intermediate; for instance, not everyone, but only one who knows, finds the midpoint in a circle.”


relative and unique to each of us. Almost without exception, this is what life does: it takes our plans and dashes them to pieces. Sometimes once, sometimes lots of times.


we are at a wonderful ball where the champagne sparkles in every glass and soft laughter falls upon the summer air. We know at some moment the black horsemen will come shattering through the terrace doors wreaking vengeance and scattering the survivors. Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking—what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.”

Booker T. Washington most famously put it, “Cast down your bucket where you are.”


Ambition,” Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, “means tying your well-being to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.”

Darwin’s proposals seemed to account for what was known, and they had an attractive logical structure to them. But, to translate an old Yiddish expression, “For instance is no proof.”


Tippett ran some careful experiments, examining the thread under the microscope after different levels of tension. He discovered that the breaking of the thread depended upon the strength of the weakest fiber in it.


The central limit theorem states that this distribution can be approximated by the normal probability distribution regardless of where the initial data came from. The normal probability distribution is the same as Laplace’s error function. It is sometimes called the “Gaussian distribution.”


Scientists, regardless of their field of expertise, are trained to apply logic and mathematical models to problems. He proposed that teams of scientists be put to work on war-related problems. Thus was born the discipline of operational research (called operations research in the United States).


Statistical analysis still uses the word significant to indicate a very low probability computed under the hypothesis being tested. In that context, the word has an exact mathematical meaning. Unfortunately, those who use statistical analysis often treat a significant test statistic as implying something much closer to the modern meaning

What can the university offer us now? It can offer the same riches that Copernicus found: the accumulated knowledge of the past, together with the liberating idea that knowledge can be transformed and become transformative. This, I believe, is the true significance of a university. It is the treasure-house in which human knowledge is devotedly protected, it provides the lifeblood on which everything that we know in the world depends, and everything that we want to do. But it is also the place where dreams are nurtured: where we have the youthful courage to question that very knowledge, in order to go forward, in order to change the world


In DRL, these computer programs are called agents. An agent is a decision maker Only and nothing else. That means if you’re training a robot to pick up objects, the robot arm isn’t part of the agent. Only the code that makes decisions is referred to as the agent.

The interactions between the agent and the environment go on for several cycles. Each cycle is called a time step. At each time step, the agent observes the environment, takes action, and receives a new observation February 16, 2022 25 The task the agent is trying to solve may or may not have a natural ending. Tasks that have a natural ending, such as a game, are called episodic tasks. Conversely, tasks that don’t are called continuing tasks, such as learning forward motion. The sequence of time steps from the beginning to the end of an episodic task is called an episode. Agents may take several time steps and episodes to learn to solve a task.

In a democratic state every man is the equal of every other man up to the point of exertion, and after that every man is free to exert himself as he chooses. I am eager for my boys and girls to exert themselves about behaving with honor. What my children appear to be on the surface is no matter to me. I am fooled neither by gracious manners nor by bad manners. I am interested in what is truly beneath each kind of manners. Whether one of my children is rich or poor, brilliant or slow, genius or simple-minded, is no matter to me, if there is humanity in him—if he has


Good friends, I know there are people who tell others to devote themselves to sitting and contemplating their minds or purity and not to move or to think. Deluded people are unaware, so they turn things upside down with their attachments. There are hundreds of such people who teach the Way like this. But they are, you should know, greatly mistaken.

Nāgārjuna will urge that all conventional phenomena are conceptually designated, depending for whatever identity and existence they have on such designation, and that this merely imputed status is their ultimate nature. Despite this, however, he will urge that seeing this fact is at the same time to see that the nature naively imputed to things and the nature they appear to us to have—inherent existence—is wholly false. In themselves, from their side, things are free of that imputation, even though there is really nothing at all that can be said from their side

Universal rejections are bound to induce a kind of a mental state, but that I can overcome if only I can keep away from the successful paper pulp boys.


Please don’t let such a long time elapse before your next letter. It is more disheartening by far than the rejections. If I weren’t so damned pig-headed I’d quit this bosh and go to work with a shovel.


I learn that all of my manuscripts have been rejected three or four times since I last heard. It is a nice thing to know that so many people are reading my books. That is one way of getting an audience.

Your telegram puts a burden of embarrassment on me. I have no reluctance toward writing an “unreticent story of my life.” Immediately there arises a problem of emphasis. Things of the greatest emphasis to me would be more or less meaningless to anyone else.


The process is this (I am writing this at the risk of being boring. One can refuse to read a letter and the writer of it will never know.) The process is this—one puts down endless observations, questions and remarks. The number grows and grows. Eventually they all seem headed in one direction and then they whirl like sparks out of a bonfire. And then one day they seem to mean something. When they do, it is the most exciting time in the world.


I am embarrassed for having to ask any one to vouch for me. It seems to me it would be better if I could simply submit a book and be judged upon the strength of it.

You ask why I don’t take Hollywood’s filthy money. Nobody’s asked me, sir. I like to think I wouldn’t take it but I probably would. I’ve been around there quite a bit and I dislike it so much that I wouldn’t want to. On the other hand we’ve been so filthy broke for so long that I would probably go nuts if anyone waved a ten dollar bill. Aren’t these nice straight lines? There’s a lined sheet underneath.


This is not clear, concise, objective thinking, but I have never been noted for any of these things. If I were a larger person I would be able to do this and come out of it untouched. But I am not.

John January 8, 2022 137 To say thank you is ridiculous for you can’t thank a man for good work any more than you can thank him for being himself. But one can be very glad he is himself and that is what we are—very glad you are George Kaufman. January 8, 2022 137 I wish I could transport into some mathematical equation, my feeling, so that it might be a communication unmistakable and unchanging.


I am sending you another version of the scene. Please understand that I am not muscling in and that this is only a suggestion. Use it if you wish or don’t use it. Don’t think me obstreperous in this matter. I don’t want to be. I think your play is gorgeous.


Some kind friend has told me about it every time you have stabbed me in the back and that whether I wanted to know it or not. I didn’t want to know it really. If such things had been reported as coming from more than one person it would be easy to discount the whole thing but there has been only one source. Now I know that such things grow out of an unhappiness in you and for a long time I was able to reason so and to keep on terms of some kind of amicability. But gradually I found I didn’t trust you at all, and when I knew that then I couldn’t be around you any more. It became obvious that anything I said or did in your presence or wrote to you would be warped viciously and repeated and then the repetition was repeated to me and the thing was just too damned painful. I tried to sidestep, just to fade out of your picture. But that doesn’t work either. January 9, 2022 147


I wish to God your unhappiness could find some other outlet. But I can’t consider you a friend when out of every contact there comes some intentionally wounding thing.

Guess that’s all. I wonder if you could get any kind of itinerary from the Sam Harris office. Maybe they haven’t one.


Los Gatos [June 1939] Dear Mr. Pearce: I’m awfully glad of your letter and I wish I could accept your invitation. But I’m working at a job that doesn’t let me stay still long enough to accept anything. Thanks just the same. One of the reasons I would like to accept is that I would like to be in the Press Club and not be thrown out. The only time I ever was there I was thrown out. Happened this way. Dick Oliver and I were in shiny evening clothes and no money and no parties and he said he was a member of the Press Club and we could go sit there until our bus left. It was 2:30 A. M. then. And I thanked him and it was raining. So we went in and it was nice and a fire was burning as I remember.


The two most important [things], I suppose—at least they seem so to me—are freedom from respectability and most important —freedom from the necessity of being consistent. Lack of those two can really tie you down.

The Time of Your LifeIn the time of your life, live – so that in that good time there shall be no ugliness or death for yourself or for any life your life touches. Seek goodness everywhere, and when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place and let it be free and unashamed.

Rebellion, though apparently negative, since it creates nothing, is profoundly positive in that it reveals the part of man which must always be defended.


We build perception out of the perceived. And since the perceived is obviously only accessible through perception, in the end we understand neither.


He quotes Harvard biology professor Robert Lue, who explains that “higher education is an organism. Our environment is changing, so we need to evolve. We need to deconstrain, to redefine how our individual components relate to one another. Organisms go extinct when they cannot mutate.”16 Most colleges and universities are not mutating; they are neither evolving their models nor tailoring their programs to attract and meet the needs of this growing population of new learners.


Loss aversion is one of the most basic and well-understood principles in social science. The basic finding is that losing something has a stronger emotional impact than gaining something of the same value


We see the triple chocolate cake, and our priorities change. In behavioral economics, we call this “present-focus bias.”


Man is a rational animal—so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life, I have looked diligently for evidence in favor of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it, though I have searched in many countries spread over three continents.


All this is depressing, but gloom is a useless emotion. In order to escape from it, I have been driven to study the past with more attention than I had formerly given to it, and have found, as Erasmus found, that folly is perennial and yet the human race has survived. The follies of our own times are easier to bear when they are seen against the background of past follies.


At one time, the most influential text in the Bible was: “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” Now-a-days, people pass over this text, in silence if possible; if not, with an apology. And so, even when we have a sacred book, we still choose as truth whatever suits our own prejudices.


nothing can be exterminated, because everything leaves a residue, and every residue is a beginning


The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, even spirituality. Ego is constantly attempting to acquire and apply the teachings of spirituality for its own benefit. The teachings are treated as an external thing, external to “me,” a philosophy which we try to imitate. We do not actually want to identify with or become the teachings. So if our teacher speaks of renunciation of ego, we attempt to mimic renunciation of ego


Whenever we begin to feel any discrepancy or conflict between our actions and the teachings, we immediately interpret the situation in such a way that the conflict is smoothed over. The interpreter is ego in the role of spiritual adviser.


My horse knew me not by the thousand approximate notions of title, function, and name which complicate human friendship, but solely by my just weight as a man. He shared my every impetus; he knew perfectly, and better perhaps than I, the point where my strength faltered under my will.


It displeases me to have some creature think that he can foresee and profit from my desire, automatically adapting himself to what he supposes to be my taste.

What are those particularities upon which we lay such store, since they count so little for us when we are liberated in sleep, and since for one second before returning, regretfully, into the body of Hadrian I was about to savor almost consciously that new existence without content and without past?

Like everyone else I have at my disposal only three means of evaluating human existence: the study of self, which is the most difficult and most dangerous method, but also the most fruitful; the observation of our fellowmen, who usually arrange to hide their secrets from us, or to make us believe that they have secrets where none exist; and books, with the particular errors of perspective to which they inevitably give rise


The poets transport us into a world which is vaster and more beautiful than our own, with more ardor and sweetness, different therefore, and in practice almost uninhabitable. The philosophers, in order to study reality pure, subject it to about the same transformations as fire or pestle make substance undergo: nothing that we have known of a person or of a fact seems to subsist in those ashes or those crystals to which they are reduced.

Historians propose to us systems too April 12, 2021 26 perfect for explaining the past, with sequence of cause and effect much too exact and clear to have been ever entirely true; they rearrange what is dead, unresisting material, and I know that even Plutarch will never recapture Alexander.

I think that I recognize the working of fate, but too many paths lead nowhere at all, and too many sums add up to nothing. To be sure, I perceive in this diversity and disorder the presence of a person; but his form seems nearly always to be shaped by the pressure of circumstances; his features are blurred, like a face reflected in water.

As everyone knows, there are insects which die in the moment of fertilization. Thus it is with all joy, life’s supreme and most voluptuous moment of pleasure is attended by death.


This is the main defect with everything human, that it is only through opposition that the object of desire is possessed. I shan’t speak of the various syndromes that can keep the psychologist busy (the melancholic has the best-developed sense of humour, the most extravagant person is often the one most prone to the picturesque, the dissolute one often the most moral, the doubter often the most religious), but simply recall that it is through sin that one first catches sight of salvation.

"Sanjaya said, 'The auspicious names (of Kesava) have been previously heard by me. Of those I will tell thee as many as I know. Kesava, however, is immeasurable, being above the power of speech to describe. He is called Vasudeva in consequence of his enveloping all creatures with the screen of illusion, or of his glorious splendour, or of his being the support and resting-place of the gods. He is called Vishnu because of his all-pervading nature. He is called Madava, O Bharata, because of his practising as a Muni, concentration of mind on truth and Yoga-absorption. He is called Madhusudana because of his having slain the Asura Madhu, and also because of his being the substance of the twenty-four objects of knowledge. Born of the Sattwata race, he is called Krishna because he uniteth in himself what are implied by the two words Krishi which signifieth 'what existeth' and na which signifieth 'eternal peace'. He is called Pundarikaksha from Pundarika implying his high and eternal abode, and Aksha implying 'indestructible'; and he is called Janardana because he striketh fear into the hearts of all wicked beings. He is called Sattwata, because the attribute of Sattwa is never dissociated from him and also because he is never dissociated from it; and he is called Vrishabhakshana from Vrishabha implying the 'Vedas' and ikshana implying 'eye', the union of the two signifying that the Vedas are his eyes, or the Vedas are the eyes through which he may be seen, That conqueror of hosts is called Aja, or unborn', because he hath not taken his birth from any being in the ordinary way. That Supreme Soul is called Damodara because unlike the gods his effulgence is increate and his own, and also because he hath self-control and great splendour. He is called Hrishikesa, from Hrishika meaning 'eternal happiness' and Isa meaning 'the six divine attributes', the union signifying one having joy, happiness, and divinity. He is called Mahavahu, because he upholdeth the earth and the sky with his two arms. He is called Adhakshaja, because he never falleth down or suffereth any deterioration, and is called Narayana from his being the refuge of all human beings. He is called Purusottama from Puru implying 'he that createth and preserveth' and so meaning 'he that destroyeth, the union signifying one that createth, preserveth, and destroyeth the universe'. He possesseth a knowledge of all things, and, therefore, is called Sarva, Krishna is always in Truth and Truth is always in him, and Govinda is Truth's Truth. Therefore, he is called Satya. He is called Vishnu because of his prowess, and Jishnu because of his success. He is called Ananta from his eternity, and Govinda from his knowledge of speech of every kind. He maketh the unreal appear as real and thereby beguileth all creatures. Possessed of such attributes, ever devoted to righteousness, and endued with divinity, the slayer of Madhu, that mighty-armed one incapable of decay, will come hither for preventing the…

Notes: 1) Dhritrastra is only asking questions, but has no desire to follow any of them. It is action which matters and not mere knowledge or knowing. He wants to hear something which conforms to his own actions, and thus there arises no need of taking a different course of action. 


"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard what the intention is of Dhritarashtra and his own. All that Sanjaya, O Krishna, said unto me hath certainly the assent of Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's soul, and spoke out his mind. An envoy speaketh according to his instructions, for if he speaketh otherwise he deserveth to be slain. Without looking equally on all that are his, moved by avarice and a sinful heart, Dhritarashtra seeketh to make peace with us without giving us back our kingdom. Indeed, at Dhritarashtra's command we spent twelve years in the woods and one additional year in concealment, well-believing, O lord, that Dhritarashtra would abide firmly by that pledge of ours. That we did not deviate from our promise is well-known to the Brahmanas who were with us. The covetous king Dhritarashtra, is now unwilling to observe Kshatriya virtues. Owing to affection for his son, he is listening to the counsels of wicked men. Abiding by counsels of Suyodhana, the king, O Janardana, actuated by avarice and seeking his own good, behaveth untruthfully towards us. What can be more sorrowful, O Janardana, than this, that I am unable to maintain my mother and my friends? Having the Kasis, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Matsyas, for my allies and with thee, O slayer of Madhu, for my protector, I prayed for only five villages, etc., Avishthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, with any other, O Govinda, as the fifth; Grant us, we said, five villages or towns, O sire, where we five may dwell in union, for we do not desire the destruction of the Bharatas. The wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra, however, regarding the lordship of the world to be; in him, doth not agree to even that. What can be more sorrowful than this? When a man born and brought up in a respectable family, covereth the possessions of others, that avarice of his destroyeth his intelligence; and intelligence being destroyed, shame is lost; and loss of shame leadeth to diminution of virtue; and loss of virtue bringeth on loss of prosperity, Destruction of prosperity, in its turn, ruineth a person, for poverty is a person's death. Kinsmen and friends and Brahmanas shun a poor man as birds avoid, O Krishna, a tree that beareth neither Rower nor fruits. Even this, O sire, is death to me that kinsmen shun me, as if I were a fallen one like the breath of life quitting 'a dead body. Samvara said that no condition of life could be more distressful than that in which one is always racked by the anxiety caused by the thought I have no meat for today, what will become of me tomorrow? It is said that wealth is the highest virtue, and everything depends on wealth. They that have wealth are said to live, whereas those that are without wealth are more dead than alive. They that by violence rob a man of his wealth not only kill the robbed but destroy also his virtue, profit and pleasure. Some men when overtaken by poverty choose death; others remove from cities to hamlets others retire into the…


For it is seen that what is the cause of the success of a person's object becometh also the cause of his ruin. Human acts, therefore, are doubtful in their consequences. Learned men, capable of judging of the evils of actions pronounce a particular course of action as worthy of being followed. It produces, however, consequences, the very opposite of what were foreseen, very much like the course of the wind. Indeed, even those acts of men that are the results of deliberation and well-directed policy, and that are consistent with considerations of propriety, are baffled


by the dispensations of Providence. Then, again, Providential dispensations, such as heat and cold and rain and hunger and thirst, that are not the consequences of human acts, may be baffled by human exertion. Then again, besides those acts which a person is pre-ordained (as the result of the act of past lives) to go through, one can always get rid of all other acts begun at his pleasure, as is testified by both the Smritis and the Srutis. Therefore, O son of Pandu, one cannot go on the world without acting. One should, hence, engage in work knowing that one's purpose would be achieved by a combination of both Destiny and Exertion.


It was not intended by me that victory would be certain in an encounter with the foe. A person, when his mind is upset should not lose his cheerfulness and must yield neither to langour nor depression.


the wise men of old have said that human affairs are set agoing in consequence of the cooperation of both providential and human expedients.


Kesava deserves all this and much more, aye, the whole earth itself. I truly swear by my own soul that thou dost not wish to give all this unto Krishna either from motives of virtue or for the object of doing what is agreeable to him. O giver of great wealth, all this betrays only deception, falsehood, and insincerity. By the external acts, O king, I know thy secret purpose.


'Worshipped or not worshipped, Janardana never becometh angry. None, however, can treat him with disrespect, for Kesava is not contemptible. Whatever, O mighty one, he purposeth to do is incapable of being frustrated by anybody by every means in his power.


Neither by learning, nor by wealth doth one become worthy of homage. It is by disposition alone that one becomes respectable, O Krishna, endued


They, however, that are superior, desire either the acutest of human suffering or the highest of all enjoyments that is given to man. The wise always delight in extremes. They find no pleasure betwixt; they regard the extreme to be happiness, while that which lies between is regarded by them as misery.


thy words, O Madhava, would command no respect among those ignorant and wicked wretches that have no reverence for all that deserveth reverence.


If a man striving to the best of his abilities to perform a virtuous act meets with failure, I have not the least doubt that the merit of that act becomes his, notwithstanding such failure. This also is known to those that are conversant with religion and scripture, that if a person having intended mentally to commit a sinful act does not actually commit it, the demerit of that act can never be his.


The learned regard him to be a wretch who doth not by his solicitation seek to save a friend who is about to sink in calamity.


Although thou hadst sought to burn him to death and hadst exiled him from human habitation, yet he came back and once more repose confidence in thee.


Indeed, these weapons have other means corresponding with the eight passions, such as lust, wrath, covetousness, vanity, insolence, pride, malice, and selfishness. Struck with them, men are confounded, and move about frantically deprived of their senses.


O Suyodhana, one should not think in this way, viz., I am strong! for O bull among men, it is seen that there are persons stronger than those generally regarded strong. O son of Kuru's race, physical strength is scarcely regarded as strength by those that are really strong.


'Persons that listen to the counsels of friends are rare. Friends again are rare that offer beneficial counsels, for a friend (in need of counsel) is never there where a friend (offering counsel) is.


That quarter is the source of all the prosperity of the gods, for it was there that Sakra was first anointed as the king of the celestials. It was there, O regenerate Rishi, that both Indra and the gods underwent their ascetic penances. It is for this, O Brahmana, that this quarter is called Purva (the first). And


the Yajurvedas were delivered by Surya (unto Yajnavalkya).


'In days of yore, Vivaswat, having performed a sacrifice, gave this quarter away as a present (Dakshina) unto his preceptor, And it is for this that this region is known by the name of Dakshina (south).


since it is here that towards the day's end (paschat) the sun dismisseth his rays that this quarter, O best of the twice-born ones, is called the west (paschima).


this quarter saveth from sin, and since one attaineth to salvation here, it is for this saying (Uttarana) power that it is called the north (uttara).


because this region is superior (uttara) to all, therefore, it is called the north (uttara). The


Death can never be brought about by one's effort. Indeed, Death is God himself.


Never entertain contempt for me, and take care that thou dost not contempt women that may even be truly blamable.


because wealth supports the world and sustains life, therefore, is it called Dhana.


Haryyaswa of Ikshaku's race, who ruled at Ayodhya,


'O Duryodhana, O bull of Bharata's race, I do not grieve for thee. I grieve, however, for this old couple, viz., Gandhari and thy father. Having thee,


If, O Madhava, we are, in the observance of the practices of our order, cut off with weapons in battle, when our end comes, even that will lead us to heaven.


Even this, O Janardana, is our highest duty as Kshatriyas, viz., that we should lay ourselves down on the field of battle on a bed of arrows. If, without bowing to our enemies, ours be the bed of arrows in battle, that, O Madhava, will never grieve us. Who is there, born in a noble race and conforming to Kshatriya practices, that would from fear bow to an enemy, desirous only of saving his life?


For the sake of a family, an individual may be sacrificed. For a village, a family may be sacrificed. For the sake of a province, a village may be sacrificed. And lastly, for the sake of one's self, the whole earth may be sacrificed.


'Hearing these words of her husband, that princess of great fame, Gandhari, desirous of what was highly beneficial, said these words,


He that desireth to obtain extensive empire must bind his senses to both profit and virtue, for if the senses are restrained, intelligence increaseth, like fire that increaseth when fed with fuel. If not controlled, these can even slay their possessor, like unbroken and furious horses, capable of killing an unskilful driver.


Lust and wrath that dwell in the body are deprived of their strength by wisdom, like a couple of fishes ensnared in a net with close holes.


O son, there is no good in battle, no virtue, no profit.


Seven days after, will be the day of the new moon. Let the battle commence then, for that day, it hath been said, is presided over by Indra.


The intelligence of two persons can never agree.


Vasudeva's wish, O Bharata, is even so. As regards myself, I dare not cast my eyes on the world without Krishna (on my side). It is for this that I follow whatever Krishna seeketh to achieve. Both of these heroes, well-skilled in encounter with the mace, are my disciples. My affection, therefore, for Bhima is equal to that for king Duryodhana. For these reasons, I shall now repair to the tirtha of the Saraswati for ablutions, for I shall not be able to behold with indifference the destruction of the Kauravas.


'Thus, O king, two persons withdrew from the battle, viz., Rohini's son (Rama) of Vrishni's race and king Rukmi.


O Suta, my understanding is capable of seeing the defects (of measures), but when I approach Duryodhana, that understanding of mine turneth away (from that right path). When such is the case, O Sanjaya, that will be which must be.


Hearing patiently, O thou that art endued with great wisdom, of the destruction of the world in the fierce battle that has been brought about, come to this conclusion and no other, viz., that man is never the agent of his acts right or wrong. Indeed, like a wooden machine, man is not an agent (in all he does). In this respect, three opinions are entertained; some say that everything is ordained by God; some say that our acts are the result of free-will; and others say that our acts are the result of those of our past lives. Listen then, therefore, with patience, to the evil that hath come upon us.'"


gods, that person whose standard of righteousness is always up, but whose sins are always concealed is said to adopt the behaviour of the cat (in the story).' I will here repeat to thee, O king, this excellent story recited by Narada to my father. A wicked cat, O king,


'My words also, O gambler's son, should be communicated unto Suyodhana. Let that morrow come to thee on which the battle is to take place. O thou of wicked soul, be a man! O fool, thou thinkest Janardana will not fight, since he hath been chosen by the Pandavas to act only as a charioteer, so thou art not alarmed. That, however, will not be, even for a moment. If my wrath is excited, I may then consume all the kings (assembled by thee) like a fire consuming a heap of straw. At Yudhishthira's command, however, I shall only discharge the functions of charioteer to the high-souled Falguni, of senses under complete control and who alone, (amongst us two) will fight! If thou fliest beyond the limits of the three worlds, if thou sinkest into the depths of the earth, thou shalt, even at these places, behold Arjuna's car tomorrow morning. Thou thinkest that Bhima's words have been spoken in vain! But know that Dussasana's blood hath already been quaffed. Know this also that although thou hast uttered such cross and perverse words, yet neither Partha, nor king Yudhishthira, nor Bhimasena, nor any of the twins, regardeth thee as straw!'"


The renunciation is sanctioned by the ordinance of a preceptor who is filled with vanity, who is destitute of the knowledge of right and wrong, and who is treading in a devious path.


Go, fight carefully and summoning all thy patience,


Who is there that would venture to baffle destiny by individual exertion?'


Mustered in battle they will kill one another. O Bharata, their hour having come, they will all perish. Bearing in mind the changes brought on by time, do not yield thy heart to grief. O king, if thou wish to see them (fighting) in battle, I will, O son, grant thee vision. Behold the battle." "Dhritarashtra said, 'O best of regenerate Rishi, I like not to behold the slaughter of kinsmen. I shall, however, through thy potency hear of this battle minutely." Vaisampayana continued. "Upon his not wishing to see the battle but wishing to hear of it, Vyasa, that lord of boons, gave a boon to Sanjaya. (And addressing Dhritarashtra he said), 'This Sanjaya, O king, will describe the battle to thee. Nothing in the whole battle will be beyond this one's eyes.' Endued, O king with celestial vision, Sanjaya will narrate the battle to thee. He will have knowledge of everything. Manifest or concealed, (happening) by day or by night, even that which is thought of in the mind, Sanjaya shall know everything. Weapons will not cut him and exertion will not fatigue him. This son of Gavalgani will come out of the battle with life. As regards myself, O bull of Bharata's race, the fame of these Kurus, as also of all the Pandavas, I will spread. Do not grieve. This is destiny, O tiger among men. It behoveth thee not to give way to grief. It is not capable of being prevented. As regards victory, it is there where righteousness is.'"


'O great king, all things in the universe, in consequence of the presence (in them) of the five elements, have been said to be equal by the wise. These elements, are space, air, fire, water, and earth. Their (respective) attributes are sound, touch, vision, taste, and scent. Every one of these elements possesses (in addition to what is especially its own) the attribute or attributes of that or those coming before it. The earth, therefore, is the foremost of them all, possessing as it does the attributes of all the other four, besides what is specially its own, as said by Rishis acquainted with truth.[32] There are four attributes, O king, in water. Scent does not exist in it. Fire has three attributes viz., sound, touch, and vision. Sound and touch belong to air, while space has sound alone. These five attributes, O king, exist (in this way) in the five principal elements depending on which all creatures in the universe exist. They exist separately and independently when there is homogeneity in the universe.[33] When, however, these do not exist in their natural state but with one another, then creatures spring into life, furnished with bodies. This is never otherwise. The elements are destroyed, in the order of the one succeeding, merging into the one that proceeds; and they spring also into existence, one arising from the one before it.[34]


Like a person desirous of crossing the sea when he beholds the boat sunk in fathomless waters,


Even the lion of mighty strength, if left unprotected may be slain by the wolf.


"Arjuna said, 'I bow to thee, O leader of Yogins, O thou that art identical with Brahman, O thou that dwellest in the forest of Mandara, O thou that art freed from decrepitude and decay, O Kali, O wife of Kapala, O thou that art of a black and tawny hue, I bow to thee. O bringer of benefits to thy devotees, I bow to thee, O Mahakali, O wife of the universal destroyer, I bow to thee. O proud one, O thou that rescuest from dangers, O thou that art endued with every auspicious attribute. O thou that art sprung from the Kata race, O thou that deservest the most regardful worship, O fierce one, O giver of victory, O victory's self, O thou that bearest a banner of peacock plumes, O thou that art decked with every ornament, O thou that bearest an awful spear, O thou that holdest a sword and shield, O thou that art the younger sister of the chief of cow-herds, O eldest one, O thou that wert born in the race of the cowherd Nanda! O thou that art always fond of buffalo's blood, O thou that wert born in the race of Kusika, O thou that art dressed in yellow robes, O thou that hadst devoured Asuras assuming the face of a wolf[120], I bow to thee that art fond of battle! O Uma,[121] Sakambhari, O thou that art white in hue, O thou that art black in hue, O thou that hast slain the Asura Kaitabha, O thou that art yellow-eyed, O thou that art diverse-eyed, O thou of eyes that have the colour of smoke, I bow to thee. O thou that art the Vedas, the Srutis, and the highest virtue, O thou that art propitious to Brahmanas engaged in sacrifice, O thou that hast a knowledge of the past, thou that art ever present in the sacred abodes erected to thee in cities of Jamvudwipa, I bow to thee. Thou art the science of Brahma among sciences, and thou that art that sleep of creatures from which there is no waking. O mother of Skanda, O thou that possessest the six (highest) attributes, O Durga, O thou that dwellest in accessible regions, thou art described as Swaha, and Swadha,[122] as Kala, as Kashta, and as Saraswati, as Savitra the mother of the Vedas, and as the science of Vedanta. With inner soul cleansed, I praise thee. O great goddess, let victory always attend me through thy grace on the field of battle. In inaccessible regions, where there is fear, in places of difficulty, in the abodes of thy worshippers and in the nether regions (Patala), thou always dwellest. Thou always defeatest the Danavas. Thou art the unconsciousness, the sleep, the illusion, the modesty, the beauty of (all creatures). Thou art the twilight, thou art the day, thou art Savitri, and thou art the mother. Thou art contentment, thou art growth, thou art light. It is thou that supportest the Sun and the Moon and that makes them shine. Thou art the prosperity of those that are prosperous. The Siddhas and the Charanas behold thee in contemplation.[123]'" Sanjaya continued, Understanding (the measure of) Partha's devotion, Durga who is always graciously inclined towards mankind, appeared in the…

Vasudeva of great wisdom smilingly said, His object is known to me. Having paid his respects to all his superiors (such as) Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, and Salya also, he will fight the foe. It is heard in histories of olden times that he who, having paid his respects according to the ordinance unto his preceptors, revered in years and his kinsmen, fighteth with those that are his superiors, is sure to obtain victory in battle. Even that is my opinion.

sinful men should often prosper in consequence of the sins they commit. A man may be seen to prosper by his sins, obtain good therefrom and vanquish his foes. Destruction, however, overtakes him to the roots.


And at first the sinful Asuras were possessed with pride. And pride begat vanity and vanity begat wrath. And from wrath arose every kind of evil propensities, and from these latter sprang shamelessness. And in consequence of shamelessness, good behaviour disappeared from among them. And because they had become shameless and destitute of virtuous propensities


and good conduct and virtuous vows, forgiveness and prosperity and morality forsook them in no time. And prosperity then, O king, sought the gods, while adversity sought the Asuras. And when the Daityas and the Danavas, deprived of sense by pride, were possessed by adversity. Kali also sought to possess them. And, O son of Kunti, overwhelmed with pride, and destitute of rites and sacrifices, and devoid of reason and feeling, and their hearts full of vanity, destruction overtook them soon.

And that one of mighty energy, and of staunch vows, with his brothers, at places went on foot and at others were carried by the Rakshasas. Then king Yudhishthira, apprehending many troubles, proceeded towards the north abounding in lions and

success in human affairs.


Fools in reality though boasting of their wisdom, alas, my children do not listen to me even though I cry out. Beholding only the honey they do not see the terrible fall that is before them. They that will rush to battle with Death himself in that human shape, are certainly doomed to destruction by the Supreme Ordainer, like animals within the lion's view.


It seems, O Sanjaya, that wisdom is incapable of dispelling woe; on the other hand, it is overwhelming woe that dispelleth wisdom.


Tied to the wheel of Time, like its periphery, I am not capable of flying away from it.


Hearing of the defeat of the Pandavas at dice, thou hadst, O king, laughed like a child, saying, 'This is won, this is acquired!'


Thou hadst, like a child, repeatedly laughed, O monarch, at the Pandavas when they were defeated at dice and were going into exile.


Vasudeva said, 'O Sanjaya, say thou these words unto the wise Dhritarashtra and in the hearing of that foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma, and also of Drona, having first saluted at our request, O Suta, all the aged ones and having enquired after the welfare of the younger ones, 'Do ye celebrate diverse sacrifices, making presents unto the Brahmanas, and rejoice with your sons and wives, for a great danger threatens ye? Do ye give away wealth unto deserving persons, beget desirable sons, and do agreeable offices to those that are dear to thee, for king Yudhishthira is eager for victory?' While I was at a distance, Krishna with tears addressing me said, 'That debt, accumulating with time, hath not yet been paid off by me. Ye have provoked hostilities with that Savyasachin, who hath for his bow the invincible Gandiva, of fiery energy, and who hath me for his helpmate. Who, even if he were Purandara himself, would challenge Partha having me for his help-mate, unless, of course, his span of life were full? He that is capable of vanquishing Arjuna in battle is, indeed, able to uphold the Earth with his two arms, to consume all created things in anger and hurl the celestials from Heaven. Among the celestials, Asuras, and men, among Yakshas, Gandharvas, and Nagas, I do not find the person that can encounter Arjuna in battle. That wonderful story which is heard of an encounter in the city of Virata between a single person on one side and innumerable warriors on the other, is sufficient proof of this. That ye all fled in all directions being routed in the city of Virata by that son of Pandu singly, is sufficient proof of this. Might, prowess, energy, speed, lightness of hand, indefatiguableness, and patience are not to be found in any one else save Partha.' Thus spoke Hrishikesa cheering up Partha by his words and roaring like rain-charged clouds in the firmament. Having heard these words of Kesava, the diadem-decked Arjuna, of white steeds, also spoke to the same effect.'"


People are always afraid of those that are without self-restraint, as if the latter were very Rakshasas. And it is for keeping these under check that the self-Existent created the Kshatriyas.


"Vidura said, 'We have heard, O sire, from old men, that once on a time a fowler spread his net on the ground for catching feathery denizens of the air. And in that net were ensnared at the same time two birds that lived together. And taking the net up, the two winged creatures soared together into the air. And seeing them soar into the sky, the fowler, without giving way to despair, began to follow them in the direction they flew, Just then, an ascetic living in a hermitage (close by), who had finished his morning prayers, saw the fowler running in that manner hoping still to secure the feathery creatures. And seeing that tenant of the earth quickly pursuing those tenants of the air, the ascetic, O Kaurava, addressed him in this Sloka, O fowler, it appears very strange and wonderful to me that thou, that art a treader of the earth, pursuest yet a couple of creatures that are tenants of the air. The fowler said, 'These two, united together, are taking away my snare. There, however, where they will quarrel they will come under my control.' "Vidura continued, 'The two birds, doomed to death, soon after quarrelled.


Once on a time we repaired to the northern mountain, accompanied by some hunters and a number of Brahmanas, fond of discoursing on charms and medicinal plants. That northern mountain, Gandhamadana, looked like a grove. As its breast was overgrown on all sides with trees and diverse kinds of luminous medicinal herbs, it was inhabited by Siddhas and Gandharvas. And there we all saw a quantity of honey, of a bright yellow colour and of the measure of a jar, placed on an inaccessible precipice of the mountain. That honey, which was Kuvera's favourite drink, was guarded by snakes of virulent poison. And it was such that a mortal, drinking of it would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight, and an old man would become a youth. It was that those Brahmanas conversant with sorcery spoke about that honey. And the hunters' seeing that honey, desired, O king, to obtain it. And they all perished in that inaccessible mountain-cave abounding with snakes. In the same way, this thy son desireth to enjoy the whole earth without a rival. He beholdeth the honey, but seeth not, from folly, the terrible fall.


Dhritarashtra caused both Gandhari and Vyasa to be brought there. And introduced by Vidura they entered the court without delay. And understanding the intentions of both Sanjaya and his son, Krishna-Dwaipayana endued with great wisdom said, 'Say, O Sanjaya,


unto the enquiring Dhritarashtra everything that he desireth to know. Tell him truly all that thou knowest about Vasudeva and Arjuna.'"

O lord of all food, it behoveth thee to grant food in abundance unto me who am desirous of food even for entertaining all my guests with reverence.

Weep not, lady, for I will exert to the utmost of my powers for the sons of Pandu! I promise thou shalt (once more) be the queen of kings! The heavens might fall, or the Himavat might split, the earth might be rent, or the waters of the ocean might dry up, but my words shall never be futile!'


O lord of earth, if I had been present at Dwaraka, then, O king, this evil would not have befallen thee! And, O irrepressible one, coming unto the gambling-match, even if uninvited by the son of Amvika (Dhritarashtra), or Duryodhana, or by the other Kauravas, I would have prevented the game from taking place, by


showing its many evils, summoning to my aid Bhishma and Drona and Kripa, and Vahlika! O exalted one, for thy sake I would have told the son of Vichitravirya O foremost of monarchs, let thy sons have nothing to do with dice! I would have shown the many evils (of dice) through which thou hast fallen into such distress and the son of Virasena was formerly deprived of his kingdom! O king, unthought of evils, befall a man from dice! I would have described how a man once engaged in the game continueth to play (from desire of victory). Women, dice, hunting and drinking to which people become addicted in consequence of temptation, have been regarded as the four evils that deprive a man of prosperity. And those versed in the Sastras are


opinion that evils attend upon all these. They also that are addicted to dice know all its evils. O thou of mighty arms, appearing before the son of Amvika, I would have pointed out that through dice men in a day lose their possessions, and fall into distress, and are deprived of their untasted wealth, and exchange harsh words! O perpetuator of the Kuru race, I would have pointed out these and other attendant evils! If he had accepted my words thus addressed, the welfare of the Kurus as also virtue itself would both have been secured! And, O foremost of kings, if he had rejected my gentle counsels offered as medicine, then, O best of the Bharata race, I would have compelled him by force! And, if those who wait at his court, professing to be his friends but in reality


his foes, had supported him, then I would have slain them all, along with those gamblers, there present! O Kauravya, it is owing to my absence from the Anartta country at that time that thou hast fallen into such distress begot of dice! O thou best of Kurus, O son of Pandu, on arriving at Dwarka I learnt from Yuyudhana all about thy calamity! And, O foremost of kings, directly I heard it with a heart sore agitated by grief, have I speedily come here wishing to see thee, O king! Alas! O bull of the Bharata race, ye have all fallen into dire distress! I see thee with thy brothers plunged in misfortune!"


Therefore should no one act unrighteously, saying, I am mighty!


'Anger is the slayer of men and is again their prosperor. Know this, O thou possessed of great wisdom, that anger is the root of all prosperity and all adversity. O thou beautiful one, he that suppresseth his anger earneth prosperity. That man, again, who always giveth way to anger, reapeth adversity from his fierce anger. It is seen in this world that anger is the cause of destruction of every creature. How then can one like me indulge his anger which is so


destructive of the world? The angry man commiteth sin. The angry man killeth even his preceptors. The angry man insulteth even his superiors in harsh words. The man that is angry faileth to distinguish between what should be said and what should not. There is no act that an angry man may not do, no word that an angry man may not utter. From anger a man may slay one that deserveth not to be slain, and may worship one that deserveth to be slain. The angry man may even send his own soul to the regions of Yama. Beholding all these faults, the wise control their anger, desirous of obtaining high prosperity both in this and the other world. It is for this that they of tranquil souls have banished wrath.


'Forgiveness


is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice, forgiveness is the Vedas, forgiveness is the Shruti. He that knoweth this is capable of forgiving everything. Forgiveness is Brahma; forgiveness is truth; forgiveness is stored ascetic merit; forgiveness protecteth the ascetic merit of the future; forgiveness is asceticism; forgiveness is holiness; and by forgiveness is it that the universe is held together. Persons that are forgiving attain to the regions obtainable by those that have preformed meritorious sacrifices, or those that are well-conversant with the Vedas, or those that have high ascetic merit. Those that perform Vedic sacrifices as also those that perform the meritorious rites of religion obtain other regions. Men of forgiveness, however, obtain those much-adored


regions that are in the world of Brahma. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind.


Suyodhana deserveth not the kingdom. Therefore hath he been unable to acquire forgiveness.


I, however, deserve the sovereignty and therefore is it that forgiveness hath taken possession of me.


One pleasure cannot lead to another, being its own fruit, as ashes may be had from wood, but nothing from those ashes in their turn.

When any of the six senses findeth its particular object, the desire springeth up in the heart to enjoy that particular object. And thus when one's heart proceedeth to enjoy the objects of any particular


sense a wish is entertained which in its turn giveth birth to a resolve. And finally, like unto an insect falling into a flame from love of light, the man falleth into the fire of temptation, pierced by the shafts of the object of enjoyment discharged by the desire constituting the seed of the resolve! And thenceforth blinded by sensual pleasure which he seeketh without stint, and steeped in dark ignorance and folly which he mistaketh for a state of happiness, he knoweth not himself! And like unto a wheel that is incessantly rolling, every creature, from ignorance and deed and desire, falleth into various states in this world, wandering from one birth to another, and rangeth

Therefore, shouldst thou act, renouncing Abhimana,[5] performance of sacrifices, study (of the Vedas), gifts, penance, truth (in both speech and act), forgiveness, subduing the senses, and


renunciation of desire, these have been declared to be the eight (cardinal) duties constituting the true path. Of these, the four first pave the way to the world of the pitris. And these should be practised without Abhimana. The four last are always observed by the pious, to attain the heaven of the gods. And the pure in spirit should ever follow these eight paths. Those who wish to subdue the world for purpose of salvation, should ever act fully renouncing motives, effectually subduing their senses, rigidly observing particular vows, devotedly serving their preceptors, austerely regulating their fare, diligently studying the Vedas, renouncing action as mean and

Thou art the refuge of those versed in the Sankhya philosophy (the mysteries of the soul), and thou art the support of the Yogins. Thou art a door unfastened with bolts. Thou art the refuge of those wishing for emancipation.


Thou sustainest and discoverest the world, and sanctifiest and supportest it from pure compassion. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas appearing before thee, adore thee in due time, reciting the hymns from the respective branches (of the Vedas) they refer. Thou art the adored of the Rishis. The Siddhas, and the Charanas and the Gandharvas and the Yakshas, and the Guhyakas, and the Nagas, desirous of obtaining boons follow thy car coursing through the skies. The thirty-three gods[8] with Upendra (Vishnu) and Mahendra, and the order of Vaimanikas[9] have attained success by worshipping thee. By offering thee garlands of the celestial Mandaras[10] the best


the Vidyadharas have obtained all their desires. The Guhyas and the seven orders of the Pitris both divine and human have attained superiority by adoring thee alone. The Vasus, the Manilas, and the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Marichipas, the Valikhilyas, and the Siddhas, have attained pre-eminence by bowing down unto thee. There is nothing that I know in the entire seven worlds, including that of Brahma which is beyond thee.

he that mindeth not the evil speeches of others, conquereth everything! The wise say that he is a true charioteer who without


slackening holdeth tightly the reins of his horses. He, therefore, is the true man that subdueth, without indulging in his rising wrath.

He is regarded as a man who by having recourse to forgiveness, shaketh off his rising anger like a snake casting off its slough He that suppresseth his anger, he that regardeth not the evil speeches of others, he that becometh not angry, though there be cause, certainly acquireth the four objects for which we live (viz., virtue, profit, desire, and salvation)


If a single person were owner of everything on Earth all her yields of paddy and barley, her silver, gold, and gems, her animals and women, he would not still be content. Thirst of enjoyment, therefore, should be given up.


One's wrath, if disregarded, burneth one's own self; but he that regardeth it not taketh away all the virtues of him that exhibiteh it.


Never shouldst thou pain others by cruel speeches. Never subdue thy foes by despicable means; and never utter such scorching and sinful words as may torture others. He

Thou art he from whom Kumara (Kartikeya) had his origin; thou art holy; thou art called

O Agni, thou who art the first cause of the waters, thou who art of great purity, thou for ministering unto whom the Vedas have sprung, thou who art the foremost of the deities, thou who art their mouth, O purify me by thy truth. Rishis and Brahmanas, Deities and Asuras pour clarified butter every day, according to the ordinance into thee during sacrifices. Let the rays of truth emanating from thee, while thou exhibitest thyself in those sacrifices,


purify me. Smoke-bannered as thou art and possessed of flames, thou great purifier from all sins born of Vayu and ever present as thou art in all creatures, O purify me by the rays of thy truth. Having cleansed myself thus cheerfully, O exalted one, do I pray unto thee. O Agni, grant me now contentment and prosperity, and knowledge and gladness.


Never striving to obtain the wealth of others, persevering in one's own affairs, and protecting what hath been earned, these are the indications of true greatness. He that is unmoved in calamity, skilled in his own business, ever exerting vigilant and humble, always beholdeth prosperity.

The pharaohs ruled Egypt for 3,000 years, and the popes dominated Europe for a millennium. If you told an Egyptian in the time of Ramses II that one day the pharaohs will be gone, he would probably have been aghast. ‘How can we live without a pharaoh? Who will ensure order, peace and justice?’ If you told people in the Middle Ages that within a few centuries God will be dead, they would have been horrified. ‘How can we live without God? Who will give life meaning and protect us from chaos?’ Looking back, many think that the downfall of the pharaohs and the death of God were both positive developments. Maybe the collapse of humanism will also be beneficial. People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.

Yet in the most turbulent fields, everything is in flux and nobody’s model works perfectly. When the extent of what’s unknown hasn’t been established, the fluidity and highly developed lateral thinking of liberal arts training can carry the day. A background in the humanities and social sciences helps you get comfortable working with scanty data when nothing better is available. You become good at building provisional inferences when others are stuck. Often your early guesses prove right, making you unusually good at spotting emerging patterns before others do.


Are you a problem solver? Can you act on opportunities? Can you find creative solutions? Can we trust you to make the go/no-go decisions? Organizations such as FedEx, McKinsey, and PayPal ask questions like these when their attention turns to critical thinking.


can’t find my college diploma anymore; it got lost somewhere in the course of ten postgraduation moves. But if I close my eyes, I can still hear a chorus of long-ago history and literature professors asking our classes: “What else? What else?”


Entry-level jobs typically adhere to well-established rules. Someone older and more experienced will tell you what to do and how to do it. This quasi-parental oversight soon fades, especially if you are ambitious. Before long, it’s time to make decisions on your own, even if the facts are hazy and the rules unknown. Your nominal bosses won’t know any more than you do.


Can you build a team? Can you balance different perspectives and agendas? Can you understand the big picture? Can you manage through influence? Employers have been looking for these sorts of socially minded strengths since at least the 1930s. At


“If students have learned to connect diverse texts and traditions, they very likely have developed the skills needed to be liaisons between software creators and end users.” Study sociology, history, or political science, and the same dynamic is in play.


Find people whose college educations emphasized taking a panoramic view of everyone else’s concerns, and those fairness-first attitudes can prevent big trouble down the road.


Can you inspire confidence? Can you energize others to embrace change? Are you concise and organized? Can you convey information effectively? There’s a new urgency in employers’ wish lists when it comes to hiring the type of person who can connect with other people.


When the Association of American Colleges and Universities asked employers recently to list the most important skills college graduates should possess, strong speaking skills showed up at the very top.


Paul Christesen asks undergraduates in the Greece study-abroad program to deliver a half-hour talk at some point summing up their backgrounds, interests, achievements, anxieties, and ambitions.


Getting a bachelor’s degree in English, psychology, history, anthropology, or other liberal arts disciplines doesn’t guarantee you a predictable job at Amalgamated History Industries for the next forty years. You will need to keep improvising your future—and that’s all right. You may switch cities two or three times in your twenties. You may switch employers five or six times. Each cycle of change expands your skills, your horizons, and your intuition for what should come next. You become both student and teacher, able to define opportunities that others can’t see.


Traditionally, our society admires people who go exploring with or without a coherent plan. We celebrate their journeys in movies, novels, and memoirs (such as Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild, and J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit). Everything usually works out in these well-known stories, even if the tiger eats the goat—or the first pair of hiking boots ends up at the bottom of a ravine. Yet when it comes to the college-to-career pathway, well-meaning advisers refuse to see the advantages of improvisation or the rewards of being prepared for the challenges of a turbulent world. Instead, all they talk about are starting salaries, starting salaries, and starting salaries.


Engineers frequently keep that lead for most of their careers, and good for them! For graduates in many other preprofessional fields, however, the earnings curve flattens out. It’s liberal arts majors, particularly those in history, political science, international relations, and philosophy, who see their earnings rocket ahead.


if you sleep through classes, skip the reading, and pay someone else to write your papers, it’s all a charade, regardless of how prestigious your school might be.


how an open-minded spirit of inquiry brought them to a better life.


Among the schools providing especially robust pipelines into good tech-sector jobs: Western Washington University, University of South Florida, San Francisco State, Arizona State, and Temple University. All of them placed at least two hundred liberal arts graduates into tech-sector jobs during the period that Ma studied.


His youngest respondents were in their twenties; his oldest in their sixties. Half of his survey looked at outcomes. Who had risen into leadership jobs? Who was earning at least a hundred thousand dollars a year? And who felt fundamentally satisfied with the way everything in life (family, health, peace of mind) had worked out? With the other half of his survey, Detweiler asked respondents to recall their actual day-to-day habits during college. Who studied a lot? Who was deeply involved in extracurricular activities? Who spent a lot of time talking about social issues with friends? Who got to know classmates with radically different attitudes and backgrounds? And who got to know professors outside of class? All told, Detweiler tracked nearly a dozen important ways that his respondents’ college experiences might have varied. Data in hand, Detweiler began looking for the top performers’ unique edge. The factor that caught his eye: building a close affinity with at least a few professors. About one-third of his respondents had made an extra effort to stop by for office hours, to meet for lunch—and to ask for professors’ job tips, life advice, and other pointers that deepened the mentor-protégé relationship. The payoff: Students who sought out faculty mentors had a 28 percent higher chance of getting a better-than-average first job after graduation. Later on, these graduates were nearly twice as likely to end up in leadership positions. Generally, they felt more fulfilled in life. And they were more likely to be seen as mentors to others.

## Seneca&#39;s Letters from a Stoic, Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Pocket Classic


For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, – boyishness. And this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.


Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should conform to society.


He is a great man who uses earthenware dishes as if they were silver; but he is equally great who uses silver as if it were earthenware. It is the sign of an unstable mind not to be able to endure riches.


The present alone can make no man wretched.


I should then begin to place a surer trust in our friendship, – the true friendship which hope and fear and self-interest cannot sever, the friendship in which and for the sake of which men meet death. 3. I can show you many who have lacked, not a friend, but a friendship; this, however, cannot possibly happen when souls are drawn together by identical inclinations into an alliance of honourable desires. And why can it not happen? Because in such cases men know that they have all things in common, especially their troubles. You cannot conceive what distinct progress I notice that each day brings to me. 4. And when you say: "Give me also a share in these gifts which you have found so helpful," I reply that I am anxious to heap all these privileges upon you, and that I am glad to learn in order that I may teach. Nothing will ever please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain the knowledge of it to myself. And if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse it. No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.


"What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself." That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind.


"Avoid whatever pleases the throng: avoid the gifts of Chance! Halt before every good which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are deceived by tempting hopes.


"Hold fast, then, to this sound and wholesome rule of life – that you indulge the body only so far as is needful for good health. The body should be treated more rigorously, that it may not be disobedient to the mind.


Still alien is whatever you have gained By coveting.


The philosopher Attalus used to say: "It is more pleasant to make than to keep a friend, as it is more pleasant to the artist to paint than to have finished painting."


Chrysippus, who declares that the wise man is in want of nothing, and yet needs many things. "On the other hand," he says, "nothing is needed by the fool, for he does not understand how to use anything, but he is in want of everything."


"But what sort of existence will the wise man have, if he be left friendless when thrown into prison, or when stranded in some foreign nation, or when delayed on a long voyage, or when out upon a lonely shore?" His life will be like that of Jupiter, who, amid the dissolution of the world, when the gods are confounded together and Nature rests for a space from her work, can retire into himself and give himself over to his own thoughts. In some such way as this the sage will act; he will retreat into himself, and live with himself.


It matters not what one says, but what one feels; also, not how one feels on one particular day, but how one feels at all times.


nature exerts her own power and through such a weakness makes her presence known even to the strongest.


Wisdom can never remove this habit; for if she could rub out all our faults, she would be mistress of the universe. Whatever is assigned to us by the terms of our birth and the blend in our constitutions, will stick with us, no matter how hard or how long the soul may have tried to master itself.


"Cherish some man of high character, and keep him ever before your eyes, living as if he were watching you, and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them."


Happy is the man who can make others better, not merely when he is in their company, but even when he is in their thoughts!


we must indeed have someone according to whom we may regulate our characters; you can never straighten that which is crooked unless you use a ruler.


My bailiff maintained that the flaws were not due to his own carelessness; "he was doing everything possible, but the house was old." And this was the house which grew under my own hands! What has the future in store for me, if stones of my own age are already crumbling?


Let us cherish and love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it. Fruits are most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close; the last drink delights the toper, the glass which souses him and puts the finishing touch on his drunkenness.


Our span of life is divided into parts; it consists of large circles enclosing smaller. One circle embraces and bounds the rest; it reaches from birth to the last day of existence.


let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say: I have lived; the course which Fortune set for me Is finished. And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts.


"It is wrong to live under constraint; but no man is constrained to live under constraint." Of course not. On all sides lie many short and simple paths to freedom; and let us thank God that no man can be kept in life. We may spurn the very constraints that hold us.


Any truth, I maintain, is my own property. And I shall continue to heap quotations from Epicurus upon you, so that all persons who swear by the words of another, and put a value upon the speaker and not upon the thing spoken, may understand that the best ideas are common property.


safety lies in not seeking safety openly; for what one avoids, one condemns,


we must follow the old adage and avoid three things with special care: hatred, jealousy, and scorn.


When the trumpet sounds, the poor man knows that he is not being attacked; when there is a cry of "Fire," he only seeks a way of escape, and does not ask what he can save;


Hunger costs but little; squeamishness costs much.


If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living simply is voluntary poverty.


if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly.


Armies have endured all manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means of food too revolting to mention. All this they have suffered to gain a kingdom, and, – what is more marvellous, – to gain a kingdom that will be another's. Will any man hesitate to endure poverty, in order that he may free his mind from madness?


Wisdom offers wealth in ready money, and pays it over to those in whose eyes she has made wealth superfluous." These


Epicurus: "The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles."


Just as it matters little whether you lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed, for whithersoever he be moved he will carry his malady with him; so one need not care whether the diseased mind is bestowed upon riches or upon poverty. His malady goes with the man.


"What is wisdom? Always desiring the same things, and always refusing the same things."


"May not a man, however, despise wealth when it lies in his very pocket?" Of course; he also is great-souled, who sees riches heaped up round him and, after wondering long and deeply because they have come into his possession, smiles, and hears rather than feels that they are his. It means much not to be spoiled by intimacy with riches; and he is truly great who is poor amidst riches. 11. "Yes, but I do not know," you say, "how the man you speak of will endure poverty, if he falls into it suddenly." Nor do I, Epicurus, know whether the poor man you speak of will despise riches, should he suddenly fall into them; accordingly, in the case of both, it is the mind that must be appraised, and we must investigate whether your man is pleased with his poverty, and whether my man is displeased with his riches. Otherwise, the cot-bed and the rags are slight proof of his good intentions, if it has not been made clear that the person concerned endures these trials not from necessity but from preference.


Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet kingdoms are all too small for us!


mere brightness and real light; the latter has a definite source within itself, the other borrows its radiance;


It is your own studies that will make you shine and will render you eminent,


"If you wish," said he, "to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires."


We can formulate general rules and commit them to writing, as to what is usually done, or ought to be done; such advice may be given, not only to our absent friends, but also to succeeding generations. In regard, however, to that second question, – when or how your plan is to be carried out, – no one will advise at long range; we must take counsel in the presence of the actual situation.


"Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered it." Take anyone off his guard, young, old, or middle-aged; you will find that all are equally afraid of death, and equally ignorant of life. No one has anything finished, because we have kept putting off into the future all our undertakings. No thought in the quotation given above pleases me more than that it taunts old men with being infants. 15. "No one," he says, "leaves this world in a different manner from one who has just been born." That is not true; for we are worse when we die than when we were born; but it is our fault, and not that of Nature.


Nature should scold us, saying: "What does this mean? I brought you into the world without desires or fears, free from superstition, treachery and the other curses. Go forth as you were when you entered!"


Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long.


foundation; it is really the pinnacle.


I do not wish you ever to be deprived of gladness. I would have it born in your house; and it is born there, if only it be inside of you. Other objects of cheer do not fill a man's bosom; they merely smooth his brow and are inconstant, – unless perhaps you believe that he who laughs has joy. The very soul must be happy and confident, lifted above every circumstance.


Epicurus and thus clear this letter of its obligation. "It is bothersome always to be beginning life." Or another, which will perhaps express the meaning better: "They live ill who are always beginning to live."


Some men, indeed, only begin to live when it is time for them to leave off living. And if this seems surprising to you, I shall add that which will surprise you still more: Some men have left off living before they have begun.


We lose our childhood, then our boyhood, and then our youth. Counting even yesterday, all past time is lost time; the very day which we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death.


(for you are always impressive, but never more pungent than when you are putting the truth in appropriate words): Not single is the death which comes; the death Which takes us off is but the last of all.


"It is absurd," he says, "to run towards death because you are tired of life, when it is your manner of life that has made you run towards death."


"What is so absurd as to seek death, when it is through fear of death that you have robbed your life of peace?" And you may add a third statement, of the same stamp: "Men are so thoughtless, nay, so mad, that some, through fear of death, force themselves to die."


I do not know whether I shall make progress; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack faith.


"Do everything as if Epicurus were watching you." There is no real doubt that it is good for one to have appointed a guardian over oneself, and to have someone whom you may look up to, someone whom you may regard as a witness of your thoughts. It is, indeed, nobler by far to live as you would live under the eyes of some good man, always at your side; but nevertheless I am content if you only act, in whatever you do, as you would act if anyone at all were looking on; because solitude prompts us to all kinds of evil.


"The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd."


"The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd." Yes, provided that you are a good, tranquil, and self-restrained man; otherwise, you had better withdraw into a crowd in order to get away from your self. Alone, you are too close to a rascal.


Put aside the opinion of the world; it is always wavering and always takes both sides. Put aside the studies which you have pursued throughout your life; Death will deliver the final judgment in your case.


You are younger; but what does that matter? There is no fixed count of our years. You do not know where death awaits you; so be ready for it everywhere.


There is only one chain which binds us to life, and that is the love of life. The chain may not be cast off, but it may be rubbed away, so that, when necessity shall demand, nothing may retard or hinder us from being ready to do at once that which at some time we are bound to do.


"Count your years, and you will be ashamed to desire and pursue the same things you desired in your boyhood days. Of this one thing make sure against your dying day, – let your faults die before you die. Away with those disordered pleasures, which must be dearly paid for; it is not only those which are to come that harm me, but also those which have come and gone. Just as crimes, even if they have not been detected when they were committed, do not allow anxiety to end with them; so with guilty pleasures, regret remains even after the pleasures are over. They are not substantial, they are not trustworthy; even if they do not harm us, they are fleeting. 3. Cast about rather for some good which will abide. But there can be no such good except as the soul discovers it for itself within itself. Virtue alone affords everlasting and peace-giving joy; even if some obstacle arise, it is but like an intervening cloud, which floats beneath the sun but never prevails against it."


No man is able to borrow or buy a sound mind; in fact, as it seems to me, even though sound minds were for sale, they would not find buyers. Depraved minds, however, are bought and sold every day.


For some persons the remedy should be merely prescribed; in the case of others, it should be forced down their throats.


For he who does not know that he has sinned does not desire correction; you must discover yourself in the wrong before you can reform yourself.


At times be harsh with yourself.


That which takes effect by chance is not an art. Now wisdom is an art; it should have a definite aim, choosing only those who will make progress, but withdrawing from those whom it has come to regard as hopeless, – yet not abandoning them too soon, and just when the case is becoming hopeless trying drastic remedies. 4. As to our friend


He will act in his usual way; he will have recourse to his wit, – the wit that can call forth smiles even from mourners. He will turn the jest, first against himself, and then against me. He will forestall every word which I am about to utter. He will quiz our philosophic systems; he will accuse philosophers of accepting doles, keeping mistresses, and indulging their appetites.


But I have decided to put up with taunts; he may stir my laughter, but I perchance shall stir him to tears; or, if he persist in his jokes, I shall rejoice, so to speak, in the midst of sorrow, because he is blessed with such a merry sort of lunacy. But that kind of merriment does not last long. Observe such men, and you will note that within a short space of time they laugh to excess and rage to excess.


if the whole state, even the women and children, sing your praises, how can I help pitying you? For I know what pathway leads to such popularity.


Now I recognize my Lucilius!


I would not have you greater or better than you planned;


Be deaf to those who love you most of all; they pray for bad things with good intentions. And, if you would be happy, entreat the gods that none of their fond desires for you may be brought to pass.


there is only one good, the cause and the support of a happy life, – trust in oneself.


I am indeed confident that you cannot be warped, that you will stick to your purpose, even though the crowd may surround and seek to distract you.


life is so short; and we make it still shorter by our unsteadiness, by making ever fresh beginnings at life, now one and immediately another. We break up life into little bits, and fritter it away.


I pray that you may get such control over yourself that your mind, now shaken by wandering thoughts, may at last come to rest and be steadfast, that it may be content with itself and, having attained an understanding of what things are truly good, – and they are in our possession as soon as we have this knowledge, – that it may have no need of added years. He has at length passed beyond all necessities – he has won his honourable discharge and is free, – who still lives after his life has been completed.


Only the poor man counts his flock.


For it is disgraceful even for an old man, or one who has sighted old age, to have a note-book knowledge. "This is what Zeno said." But what have you yourself said? "This is the opinion of Cleanthes." But what is your own opinion? How long shall you march under another man's orders?


But it is one thing to remember, another to know. Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the copy and not all the time glancing back at the master.


Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth lies open for all; it has not yet been monopolized. And there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover.


I claim you for myself; you are my handiwork. When I saw your abilities, I laid my hand upon you, I exhorted you, I applied the goad and did not permit you to march lazily, but roused you continually. And now I do the same; but by this time I am cheering on one who is in the race and so in turn cheers me on.


You know what I mean by a good man? One who is complete, finished, – whom no constraint or need can render bad. 4. I see such a person in you, if only you go steadily on and bend to your task, and see to it that all your actions and words harmonize and correspond with each other and are stamped in the same mould. If a man's acts are out of harmony, his soul is crooked.


the young man must store up, the old man must use.


night has overwhelmed the sun, but day will soon rout the night again.


infants, and boys, and those who have gone mad, have no fear of death, and it is most shameful if reason cannot afford us that peace of mind to which they have been brought by their folly.


"Then how can I free myself?" you ask. You cannot escape necessities, but you can overcome them By force a way is made. And this way will be afforded


if reason becomes your ruler, you will become ruler over many.


You can show me no man who knows how he began to crave that which he craves. He has not been led to that pass by forethought; he has been driven to it by impulse. Fortune attacks us as often as we attack Fortune.


That is why, in Homer, the rapid style, which sweeps down without a break like a snow-squall, is assigned to the younger speaker; from the old man eloquence flows gently, sweeter than honey.


The lion with gilded mane, in process of being trained and forced by weariness to endure the decoration, is sent into the arena in quite a different way from the wild lion whose spirit is unbroken; the latter, indeed, bold in his attack, as nature wished him to be, impressive because of his wild appearance, – and it is his glory that none can look upon him without fear, – is favoured in preference to the other lion, that languid and gilded brute.


The easiest thing in the world, – to live in accordance with his own nature. But this is turned into a hard task by the general madness of mankind; we push one another into vice. And how can a man be recalled to salvation, when he has none to restrain him, and all mankind to urge him on?


there is no worse penalty for vice than the fact that it is dissatisfied with itself and all its fellows.


we regard things as free gifts when they really cost us very dear.


Our stupidity may be clearly proved by the fact that we hold that "buying" refers only to the objects for which we pay cash, and we regard as free gifts the things for which we spend our very selves.


He that owns himself has lost nothing. But how few men are blessed with ownership of self!


I shall mention a fact by which you may weigh the worth of a man's character: you will scarcely find anyone who can live with his door wide open. It is our conscience, not our pride, that has put doorkeepers at our doors; we live in such a fashion that being suddenly disclosed to view is equivalent to being caught in the act.


If your deeds are honourable, let everybody know them; if base, what matters it that no one knows them, as long as you yourself know them? How wretched you are if you despise such a witness!


For I have sold myself to no man; I bear the name of no master. I give much credit to the judgment of great men; but I claim something also for my own. For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to be sought.


They postpone everything. Even if we paid strict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but as we are now, life finds us lingering and passes us by as if it belonged to another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day.


The sunlight called to me, hunger warned, and clouds were lowering; but I absorbed the book from beginning to end.


Your style is lofty and noble; I want you to keep to this manner and this direction.


Each man acquires his character for himself, but accident assigns his duties.


Invite some to your table because they deserve the honor, and others that they may come to deserve it.


Show me a man who is not a slave; one is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to ambition, and all men are slaves to fear.


But the fact is, the same thing is advantageous to me which is advantageous to you; for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue concerning you is my concern also.


Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common.


Frankness, and simplicity beseem true goodness. Even if there were many years left to you, you would have had to spend them frugally in order to have enough for the necessary things; but as it is, when your time is so scant, what madness it is to learn superfluous things!


It was but a moment ago that I sat, as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion, but a moment ago that I began to plead in the courts, but a moment ago that I lost the desire to plead, but a moment ago that I lost the ability. Infinitely swift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who are looking backwards. For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is the passage of time's headlong flight.


The time which we spend in living is but a point, nay, even less than a point. But this point of time, infinitesimal as it is, nature has mocked by making it seem outwardly of longer duration; she has taken one portion thereof and made it infancy, another childhood, another youth, another the gradual slope, so to speak, from youth to old age, and old age itself is still another. How many steps for how short a climb!


It was but a moment ago that I saw you off on your journey; and yet this "moment ago" makes up a goodly share of our existence, which is so brief, we should reflect, that it will soon come to an end altogether. In other years time did not seem to me to go so swiftly; now, it seems fast beyond belief,


For what else are you busied with except improving yourself every day, laying aside some error, and coming to understand that the faults which you attribute to circumstances are in yourself? We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.


whenever I wish to enjoy the quips of a clown, I am not compelled to hunt far; I can laugh at myself.


however much the timber may be bent, you can make it straight again.


There is no man to whom a good mind comes before an evil one. It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us. Learning virtue means unlearning vice.


We ought to select abodes which are wholesome not only for the body but also for the character. Just as I do not care to live in a place of torture, neither do I care to live in a cafe.


We should toughen our minds, and remove them far from the allurements of pleasure.


Both ambition and anger will wish to have the same rights over me as pleasure, and I shall be torn asunder, or rather pulled to pieces, amid all these conflicting passions. 9. I have set freedom before my eyes; and I am striving for that reward. And what is freedom, you ask? It means not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it means compelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms. And on the day when I know that I have the upper hand, her power will be naught.


If any vice rend your heart, cast it away from you; and if you cannot be rid of it in any other way, pluck out your heart also. Above all, drive pleasures from your sight. Hate them beyond all other things, for they are like the bandits whom the Egyptians call "lovers," who embrace us only to garrotte us.


Nor need you despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance of another; the will to be saved means a great deal, too.


I should accordingly deem more fortunate the man who has never had any trouble with himself; but the other, I feel, has deserved better of himself, who has won a victory over the meanness of his own nature, and has not gently led himself, but has wrestled his way, to wisdom.


We can get assistance not only from the living, but from those of the past.


Choose as a guide one whom you will admire more when you see him act than when you hear him speak.


How mad is he who leaves the lecture-room in a happy frame of mind simply because of applause from the ignorant! Why do you take pleasure in being praised by men whom you yourself cannot praise?


all acts are always significant, and you can gauge character by even the most trifling signs. The lecherous man is revealed by his gait, by a movement of the hand, sometimes by a single answer, by his touching his head with a finger, by the shifting of his eye. The scamp is shown up by his laugh;


Throw aside all hindrances and give up your time to getting a sound mind; for no man can attain it if he is engrossed in other matters.


Alexander, when a certain state promised him a part of its territory and half its entire property, replied: "I invaded Asia with the intention, not of accepting what you might give, but of allowing you to keep what I might leave."


Do you ask what will be the difference between yourself and the gods? They will live longer.


What was before me will happen again after me. If there is any suffering in this state, there must have been such suffering also in the past, before we entered the light of day. As a matter of fact, however, we felt no discomfort then. 5. And I ask you, would you not say that one was the greatest of fools who believed that a lamp was worse off when it was extinguished than before it was lighted?


death. For what does it matter whether you do not begin at all, or whether you leave off, inasmuch as the result of both these states is non-existence?


He who lives for no one does not necessarily live for himself. Nevertheless, there is so much in steadfastness and adherence to one's purpose that even sluggishness, if stubbornly maintained, assumes an air of authority with us.


You may hold converse with your friends when they are absent, and indeed as often as you wish and for as long as you wish.


A friend should be retained in the spirit; such a friend can never be absent. He


You need not suppose that the soul is at peace when the body is still. Sometimes quiet means disquiet.


For what difference does it make whether a watchtower or a mountain crashes down upon us? No difference at all, you will find. Nevertheless, there will be some men who fear the latter mishap to a greater degree, though both accidents are equally deadly; so true it is that fear looks not to the effect, but to the cause of the effect.


But there are certain things which have life (anima) and yet are not "animals." For it is agreed that plants and trees


"Very well," say you, "what good shall I get from all this fine reasoning?" None, if you wish me to answer your question. Nevertheless, just as an engraver rests his eyes when they have long been under a strain and are weary, and calls them from their work, and "feasts" them, as the saying is; so we at times should slacken our minds and refresh them with some sort of entertainment. But let even your entertainment


Let us despise everything that is so little an object of value that it makes us doubt whether it exists at all.


Plato himself, by taking pains, advanced to old age. To be sure, he was the fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his very name was given him because of his broad chest); but his strength was much impaired by sea voyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by setting a limit upon all that rouses the appetites, and by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in spite of many hindrances.


Frugal living can bring one to old age; and to my mind old age is not to be refused any more than is to be craved. There is a pleasure in being in one's own company as long as possible, when a man has made himself worth enjoying. The question, therefore, on which we have to record our judgment is, whether one should shrink from extreme old age and should hasten the end artificially, instead of waiting for it to come. A man who sluggishly awaits his fate is almost a coward, just as he is immoderately given to wine who drains the jar dry and sucks up even the dregs. 33. But we shall ask this question also: "Is the extremity of life the dregs, or is it the clearest and purest part of all, provided only that the mind is unimpaired, and the senses, still sound, give their support to the spirit, and the body is not worn out and dead before its time?" For it makes a great deal of difference whether a man is lengthening his life or his death.


He who dies just because he is in pain is a weakling, a coward; but he who lives merely to brave out this pain, is a fool.


But I am running on too long; and, besides, there is matter here to fill a day. And how can a man end his life, if he cannot end a letter? So farewell. This last word you will read with greater pleasure than all my deadly talk about death.

Notes: 1) One of the few instances where Seneca is cracking a joke. 


For "joy" is an elation of spirit, of a spirit which trusts in the goodness and truth of its own possessions. The common usage, however, is that we derive great "joy" from a friend's position as consul, or from his marriage, or from the birth of his child; but these events, so far from being matters of joy, are more often the beginnings of sorrow to come. No, it is a characteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and never changes into its opposite.


is likely soon to take another direction, I call it "pleasure"; for it is inspired by an opinion concerning a spurious good; it exceeds control and is carried to excess.


You say all that you wish, and you mean still more than you say. This is a proof of the importance of your subject matter, showing that your mind, as well as your words, contains nothing superfluous or bombastic.


"This," said he, "is just what the wise man ought to do; he should have all his fighting qualities deployed on every side, so that wherever the attack threatens, there his supports may be ready to hand and may obey the captain's command without confusion."


It is, primarily, because we do not combat it strongly enough, because we do not struggle towards salvation with all our might; secondly, because we do not put sufficient trust in the discoveries of the wise, and do not drink in their words with open hearts;


Each man, according to his lot in life, is stultified by flattery. We should say to him who flatters us: "You call me a man of sense, but I understand how many of the things which I crave are useless, and how many of the things which I desire will do me harm. I have not even the knowledge, which satiety teaches to animals, of what should be the measure of my food or my drink. I do not yet know how much I can hold."


When men have wearied themselves with wine and lust, when night fails them before their debauch is done, when the pleasures which they have heaped upon a body that is too small to hold them begin to fester, at such times they utter in their wretchedness those lines of Vergil: Thou knowest how, amid false-glittering joys. We spent that last of nights.


It is not the natural hunger of our bellies that costs us dear, but our solicitous cravings. 4. Therefore those who, as Sallust puts it, "hearken to their bellies," should be numbered among the animals, and not among men; and certain men, indeed, should be numbered, not even among the animals, but among the dead.


Let us cease to desire that which we have been desiring. I, at least, am doing this: in my old age I have ceased to desire what I desired when a boy. To this single end my days and my nights are passed; this is my task, this the object of my thoughts, – to put an end to my chronic ills.


As soon as you cease to observe yourself, the picture of sorrow which you have contemplated will fade away; at present you are keeping watch over your own suffering. But even while you keep watch it slips away from you, and the sharper it is, the more speedily it comes to an end.


For, as my friend Attalus used to say: "The remembrance of lost friends is pleasant in the same way that certain fruits have an agreeably acid taste, or as in extremely old wines it is their very bitterness that pleases us. Indeed, after a certain lapse of time, every thought that gave pain is quenched, and the pleasure comes to us unalloyed."


If, on the other hand, we have no other friends, we have injured ourselves more than Fortune has injured us; since Fortune has robbed us of one friend, but we have robbed ourselves of every friend whom we have failed to make.


Again, he who has been unable to love more than one, has had none too much love even for that one. If a man who has lost his one and only tunic through robbery chooses to bewail his plight rather than look about him for some way to escape the cold, or for something with which to cover his shoulders, would you not think him an utter fool?


I should prefer you to abandon grief, rather than have grief abandon you;


Yesterday you were with us. You might complain if I said "yesterday" merely. This is why I have added "with us." For, so far as I am concerned, you are always with me. Certain


gradually your fastidiousness would reach such a point that, of two equally just and prudent men, you would choose him who has long curling hair! Whenever the virtue in each one is equal, the inequality in their other attributes is not apparent. For all other things are not parts, but merely accessories.


For no man loves his native land because it is great; he loves it because it is his own.


Whenever your letters arrive, I imagine that I am with you, and I have the feeling that I am about to speak my answer, instead of writing it.


Certain animals hide themselves from discovery by confusing the marks of their foot-prints in the neighbourhood of their lairs. You should do the same. Otherwise, there will always be someone dogging your footsteps. Many men pass by that which is visible, and peer after things hidden and concealed; a locked room invites the thief. Things which lie in the open appear cheap; the house-breaker passes by that which is exposed to view. This is the way of the world, and the way of all ignorant men: they crave to burst in upon hidden things.


When you withdraw from the world your business is to talk with yourself, not to have men talk about you. But what shall you talk about? Do just what people are fond of doing when they talk about their neighbours, – speak ill of yourself when by yourself; then you will become accustomed both to speak and to hear the truth.


So it is with our souls; there are in them certain parts which are, so to speak, on the sick-list, and to these parts the cure must be applied.


I would rather have you say, on leaving my presence: "I used to think him a happy man and a learned one, and I had pricked up my ears to hear him; but I have been defrauded. I have seen nothing, heard nothing which I craved and which I came back to hear." If you feel thus, and speak thus, some progress has been made. I prefer you to pardon rather than envy my retirement.


he who has attained wisdom in his old age, has attained it by his years.


And the spirit cannot through retirement grow into unity unless it has ceased from its inquisitiveness and its wanderings. To be able to hold your spirit in check, you must first stop the runaway flight of the body.


Just as he who tries to be rid of an old love must avoid every reminder of the person once held dear (for nothing grows again so easily as love), similarly, he who would lay aside his desire for all the things which he used to crave so passionately, must turn away both eyes and ears from the objects which he has abandoned. The emotions soon return to the attack;


Lands and towns are left astern,


The archer must know what he is seeking to hit; then he must aim and control the weapon by his skill. Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind. Chance must necessarily have great influence over our lives, because we live by chance.


Rouse yourself, most excellent Lucilius, and leave off all this word-play of the philosophers, who reduce a most glorious subject to a matter of syllables, and lower and wear out the soul by teaching fragments; then you will become like the men who discovered these precepts, instead of those who by their teaching do their best to make philosophy seem difficult rather than great.


There is nothing that does not have its old age; the intervals are merely unequal at which Nature sends forth all these things towards the same goal. Whatever is will cease to be, and


for we behold only that which is nearest; our sluggish mind, under allegiance to the body, does not penetrate to bournes beyond. Were it not so, the mind would endure with greater courage its own ending and that of its possessions, if only it could hope that life and death, like the whole universe about us, go by turns, that whatever has been put together is broken up again, that whatever has been broken up is put together again, and that the eternal craftsmanship of God, who controls all things is working at this task.


All acts in which virtue has disclosed itself are of the same measure and value.


To a luxurious man, a simple life is a penalty; to a lazy man, work is punishment; the dandy pities the diligent man; to the slothful, studies are torture.


he is made up of two parts: the one part is irrational, – it is this that may be bitten, burned, or hurt; the other part is rational, – it is this which holds resolutely to opinions, is courageous, and unconquerable. In the latter is situated man's Supreme Good.


Let us see to it that all time belongs to us. This, however, cannot be unless first of all our own selves begin to belong to us.


For health of body is a temporary matter which the physician cannot guarantee, even though he has restored it; nay, he is often roused from his bed to visit the same patient who summoned him before. The mind, however, once healed, is healed for good and all.


That is the trouble with every sort of ambition; it does not look back. Nor is it ambition alone that is fickle, but also every sort of craving, because it always begins where it ought to end.


Just as a man honours and reveres his teachers, by whose aid he has found release from his early wanderings, so the sage honours these men, also, under whose guardianship he can put his good theories into practice.


I owe a great debt to the sun and to the moon; and yet they do not rise for me alone.


You will find men who are completely upset by failure to win an election, and others who are actually plagued by the offices which they have won.


The most sensible man, therefore, as soon as he sees the dole being brought in, runs from the theatre; for he knows that one pays a high price for small favours. No one will grapple with him on the way out, or strike him as he departs; the quarrelling takes place where the prizes are.


Few men have been permitted to lay aside prosperity gently. The rest all fall, together with the things amid which they have come into eminence, and they are weighted down by the very things which had before exalted them. 19. For this reason foresight must be brought into play, to insist upon a limit or upon frugality in the use of these things, since license overthrows and destroys its own abundance.


Love reason! The love of reason will arm you against the greatest hardships.


let us say what we feel, and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life. That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person both when you see him and when you hear him.


Our words should aim not to please, but to help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without painstaking, and if you either are naturally gifted or can gain eloquence at slight cost, make the most of it and apply it to the noblest uses.


For though he who makes progress is still numbered with the fools, yet he is separated from them by a long interval.


Now what is more foolish than refusing to learn, simply because one has not been learning for a long time?


You should keep learning as long as you are ignorant,


"As long as you live, keep learning how to live."


"How much progress shall I make?" you ask. Just as much as you try to make.


Money will come of its own accord; titles will be given to you; influence and authority will perhaps be thrust upon you; but virtue will not fall upon you by chance.


things. A ship is said to be good not when it is decorated with costly colours, nor when its prow is covered with silver or gold or its figure-head embossed in ivory, nor when it is laden with the imperial revenues or with the wealth of kings, but when it is steady and staunch and taut, with seams that keep out the water, stout enough to endure the buffeting of the waves' obedient to its helm, swift and caring naught for the winds.


will speak of a sword as good, not when its sword-belt is of gold, or its scabbard studded with gems, but when its edge is fine for cutting and its point will pierce any armour.


But the wise man knows that all things are in store for him. Whatever happens, he says: "I knew it." Farewell.


Yes, I repeat, it seemed to me that I should continue to live, not with them, but through them. I imagined myself not to be yielding up my soul, but to be making it over to them.

Notes: 1) Friends 


Besides, every one adds much to his own ills, and tells lies to himself. And that which was bitter to bear is pleasant to have borne; it is natural to rejoice at the ending of one's ills.


Perchance some day the memory of this sorrow Will even bring delight.


So let us also win the way to victory in all our struggles, – for the reward is not a garland or a palm or a trumpeter who calls for silence at the proclamation of our names, but rather virtue, steadfastness of soul, and a peace that is won for all time, if fortune has once been utterly vanquished in any combat. You


He knows that honourable things do not depend on time for their growth; but any life must seem short to those who measure its length by pleasures which are empty and for that reason unbounded.


hold fast to this thought, and grip it close: yield not to adversity; trust not to prosperity; keep before your eyes the full scope of Fortune's power, as if she would surely do whatever is in her power to do. That which has been long expected comes more gently.


For although the body needs many things in order to be strong, yet the mind grows from within, giving to itself nourishment and exercise. Yonder athletes must have copious food, copious drink, copious quantities of oil, and long training besides; but you can acquire virtue without equipment and without expense. All that goes to make you a good man lies within yourself. 4. And what do you need in order to become good? To wish it.


For this is what makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back over his own life. Our thoughts are devoted only to what we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future always depend on the past.


my exercise costs very little effort; as soon as I stir, I am tired.


I am referring to the chorus which the old-time philosophers knew; in our present-day exhibitions we have a larger number of singers than there used to be spectators in the theatres of old. All the aisles are filled with rows of singers; brass instruments surround the auditorium; the stage resounds with flutes and instruments of every description; and yet from the discordant sounds a harmony is produced. I would have my mind of such a quality as this; it should be equipped with many arts, many precepts, and patterns of conduct taken from many epochs of history; but all should blend harmoniously into one.


you see how wretched a man's plight is if he who is the object of envy feels envy also."


"He that possesses prudence is also self-restrained; he that possesses self-restraint is also unwavering; he that is unwavering is unperturbed; he that is unperturbed is free from sadness; he that is free from sadness is happy. Therefore, the prudent man is happy, and prudence is sufficient to constitute the happy life."


But how petty is the superiority which we attribute to the wise man, if he is merely braver than the most craven, happier than the most dejected, more self-controlled than the most unbridled, and greater than the lowliest! Would Ladas boast his swiftness in running by comparing himself with the halt and the weak?

Notes: 1) "He that possesses prudence is also self-restrained; he that possesses self-restraint is also unwavering; he that is unwavering is unperturbed; he that is unperturbed is free from sadness; he that is free from sadness is happy. Therefore, the prudent man is happy, and prudence is sufficient to constitute the happy life." 


Tigers and lions never put off their wildness; they sometimes moderate it, and then, when you are least prepared, their softened fierceness is roused to madness. Vices are never genuinely tamed.


you grant any privileges to sadness, fear, desire, and all the other wrong impulses, they will cease to lie within our jurisdiction. And why? Simply because the means of arousing them lie outside our own power. They will accordingly increase in proportion as the causes by which they are stirred up are greater or less.


if the happy life is in want of nothing, then every happy life is perfect; it is happy and at the same time most happy. Have you any doubt that the happy


But the happy man prefers no other man's life to his own.


I will tell you what is the source of this error: men do not understand that the happy life is a unit; for it is its essence, and not its extent, that establishes such a life on the noblest Plane. Hence there is complete equality between the life that is long and the life that is short, between that which is spread out and that which is confined, between that whose influence is felt in many places and in many directions, and that which is restricted to one interest.


The arts render a slave's service to life; wisdom issues the commands.


A pilot has a double rôle: one he shares with all his fellow-passengers, for he also is a passenger; the other is peculiar to him, for he is the pilot. The storm harms him as a passenger, but not as a pilot.


pilot's art is another's good – it concerns his passengers just as a physician's art concerns his patients. But the wise man's good is a common good – it belongs both to those in whose company he lives, and to himself also.


So the wise man will develop virtue, if he may, in the midst of wealth, or, if not, in poverty; if possible, in his own country – if not, in exile; if possible, as a commander – if not, as a common soldier; if possible, in sound health – if not, enfeebled. Whatever fortune he finds, he will accomplish therefrom something noteworthy.


We have become so luxurious that we will have nothing but precious stones to walk upon.


he taught me that a tree can be transplanted, no matter how far gone in years.


you too shall be shaded by the tree which Is slow to grow, but bringeth shade to cheer Your grandsons in the far-off years, as our poet Vergil says.


I do not intend to tell you any more of these precepts, lest, as Aegialus did with me, I may be training you up to be my competitor.


yet I shall, whenever you are willing to listen, nay, even though you be unwilling, prove to you that these words are by no means untrue, nor so surprising as one at first sight would think.


proof that this conduct which I approve and applaud has not yet gained a firm and steadfast dwelling-place within me.


Or perchance you think it matters whether one has borrowed from another man or from Fortune.


Wisdom is a large and spacious thing. It needs plenty of free room. One must learn about things divine and human, the past and the future, the ephemeral and the eternal; and one must learn about Time.


Let all other things be driven out, and let the breast be emptied to receive virtue.


It is at the cost of a vast outlay of time and of vast discomfort to the ears of others that we win such praise as this: "What a learned man you are!" Let us be content with this recommendation, less citified though it be: "What a good man you are!"


they know more about careful speaking than about careful living.


If I cleave to Protagoras, there is nothing in the scheme of nature that is not doubtful; if I hold with Nausiphanes, I am sure only of this – that everything is unsure; if with Parmenides, there is nothing except the One; if with Zeno, there is not even the One. 46. What are we, then? What becomes of all these things that surround us, support us, sustain us? The whole universe is then a vain or deceptive shadow. I cannot readily say whether I am more vexed at those who would have it that we know nothing, or with those who would not leave us even this privilege. Farewell.


Just as it is hard to take in what is indefinitely large, so it is hard to take in what is indefinitely small.


For over-analysis is faulty in precisely the same way as no analysis at all; whatever you cut so fine that it becomes dust is as good as blended into a mass again.


Wisdom is the perfect good of the human mind; philosophy is the love of wisdom, and the endeavour to attain it.


Study, not in order to add anything to your knowledge, but to make your knowledge better.


Who can doubt, my dear Lucilius, that life is the gift of the immortal gods, but that living well is the gift of philosophy?


For men cease to possess all things the moment they desire all things for their own.


The things that are indispensable require no elaborate pains for their acquisition; it is only the luxuries that call for labour. Follow nature, and you will need no skilled craftsmen.


She shows us what things are evil and what things are seemingly evil; she strips our minds of vain illusion. She bestows upon us a greatness which is substantial, but she represses the greatness which is inflated, and showy but filled with emptiness; and she does not permit us to be ignorant of the difference between what is great and what is but swollen; nay, she delivers to us the knowledge of the whole of nature and of her own nature.

Notes: 1) She is wisdom here 


Chance chooses some new weapon by which to bring her strength to bear against us, thinking we have forgotten her. 6. Whatever structure has been reared by a long sequence of years, at the cost of great toil and through the great kindness of the gods, is scattered and dispersed by a single day. Nay, he who has said "a day" has granted too long a postponement to swift-coming misfortune; an hour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of empires! It would be some consolation for the feebleness of our selves and our works, if all things should perish as slowly as they come into being; but as it is, increases are of sluggish growth, but the way to ruin is rapid. 7.


Therefore let the mind be disciplined to understand and to endure its own lot, and let it have the knowledge that there is nothing which fortune does not dare – that she has the same jurisdiction over empires as over emperors, the same power over cities as over the citizens who dwell therein. We must not cry out at any of these calamities. Into such a world have we entered, and under such laws do we live. If you like it, obey; if not, depart whithersoever you wish. Cry out in anger if any unfair measures are taken with reference to you individually; but if this inevitable law is binding upon the highest and the lowest alike, be reconciled to fate, by which all things are dissolved. 16. You should not estimate our worth by our funeral mounds or by these monuments of unequal size which line the road; their ashes level all men! We are unequal at birth, but are equal in death. What I say about cities I say also about their inhabitants. Ardea


Imagine that nature is saying to us: "Those things of which you complain are the same for all. I cannot give anything easier to any man, but whoever wishes will make things easier for himself." In what way? By equanimity.


Your fearing death is therefore like your fear of gossip. But what is more foolish than a man afraid of words? Our friend Demetrius is wont to put it cleverly when he says: "For me the talk of ignorant men is like the rumblings which issue from the belly. For," he adds, "what difference does it make to me whether such rumblings come from above or from below?"


Does it do any harm to a good man to be besmirched by unjust gossip?


happy life depends upon this and this alone: our attainment of perfect reason. For it is naught but this that keeps the soul


That man, I declare, is happy whom nothing makes less strong than he is; he keeps to the heights, leaning upon none but himself; for one who sustains himself by any prop may fall.


what absurdity lies in not being content with the daylight unless it is increased by a tiny fire. What importance can a spark have in the midst of this clear sunlight?


For when I don suitable attire, or walk as I should, or dine as I ought to dine, it is not my dinner, or my walk, or my dress that are goods, but the deliberate choice which I show in regard to them, as I observe, in each thing I do, a mean that conforms with reason.


Our actions are honourable, but not the actual things which we do.


For nature has surrounded our soul with the body as with a sort of garment; the body is its cloak. But who has ever reckoned the value of clothes by the wardrobe which contained them? The scabbard does not make the sword good or bad. Therefore, with regard to the body I shall return the same answer to you, – that, if I have the choice, I shall choose health and strength, but that the good involved will be my judgment regarding these things, and not the things themselves.


The sun, however, is unimpaired even in the midst of obstacles, and, though an object may intervene and cut off our view thereof, the sun sticks to his work and goes on his course. Whenever he shines forth from amid the clouds, he is no smaller, nor less punctual either, than when he is free from clouds; since it makes a great deal of difference whether there is merely something in the way of his light or something which interferes with his shining.


The other man has lived eighty years, has he? Nay, he has existed eighty years, unless perchance you mean by "he has lived" what we mean when we say that a tree "lives."


I have looked upon every day as if it were my last. Why ask the date of my birth, or whether I am still enrolled on the register of the younger men? What I have is my own.


And what, you ask, is the fullest span of life? It is living until you possess wisdom. He


you will merely be showing the sick man what he ought to do if he were well, instead of making him well.


People say: "What good does it do to point out the obvious?" A great deal of good; for we sometimes know facts without paying attention to them. Advice is not teaching; it merely engages the attention and rouses us, and concentrates the memory, and keeps it from losing grip. We miss much that is set before our very eyes. Advice is, in fact, a sort of exhortation. The mind often tries not to notice even that which lies before our eyes; we must therefore force upon it the knowledge of things that are perfectly well known.


Wisdom of Cato "Buy not what you need, but what you must have. That which you do not need, is dear even at a farthing."


you must learn first, and then strengthen your learning by action.


Each man, in corrupting others, corrupts himself; he imbibes, and then imparts, badness the result is a vast mass of wickedness, because the worst in every separate person is concentrated in one mass.


Nature does not ally us with any vice; she produced us in health and freedom. She put before our eyes no object which might stir in us the itch of greed. She placed gold and silver beneath our feet, and bade those feet stamp down and crush everything that causes us to be stamped down and crushed. Nature elevated our gaze towards the sky and willed that we should look upward to behold her glorious and wonderful works.


mine-shaft. There is nothing uglier than these metals during the process of refinement and separation from the ore. Furthermore, watch the very workmen who must handle and sift the barren grade of dirt, the sort which comes from the bottom; see how soot-besmeared they are! 59. And yet the stuff they handle soils the soul more than the body, and there is more foulness in the owner than in the workman.


Alexander was hounded into misfortune and dispatched to unknown countries by a mad desire to lay waste other men's territory. Do you believe that the man was in his senses who could begin by devastating Greece, the land where he received his education? One who snatched away the dearest guerdon of each nation, bidding Spartans be slaves, and Athenians hold their tongues? Not content with the ruin of all the states which Philip had either conquered or bribed into bondage, he overthrew various commonwealths in various places and carried his weapons all over the world; his cruelty was tired, but it never ceased – like a wild beast that tears to pieces more than its hunger demands.


He does not wish to go; but he cannot stay; he is like a weight that falls headlong, its course ending only when it lies motionless.


For sometimes we seek with effort that which we should decline if offered voluntarily.


that art which professes to teach the art of life cannot be forbidden by any circumstance from exercising its functions; for it shakes off complications and pierces through obstacles. Would you like to know how unlike its status is to the other arts? In the case of the latter, it is more pardonable to err voluntarily rather than by accident; but in the case of wisdom the worst fault is to commit sin wilfully. 9. I mean something like this: A scholar will blush for shame, not if he makes a grammatical blunder intentionally, but if he makes it unintentionally; if a physician does not recognize that his patient is failing, he is a much poorer practitioner than if he recognizes the fact and conceals his knowledge. But in this art of living a voluntary mistake is the more shameful.


People say: "The old-style wisdom advised only what one should do and avoid; and yet the men of former days were better men by far. When savants have appeared, sages have become rare. For that frank, simple virtue has changed into hidden and crafty knowledge; we are taught how to debate, not how to live." 14. Of course, as you say, the old-fashioned wisdom, especially in its beginnings, was crude; but so were the other arts, in which dexterity developed with progress. Nor indeed in those days was there yet any need for carefully-planned cures. Wickedness had not yet reached such a high point, or scattered itself so broadcast. Plain vices could be treated by plain cures; now, however, we need defences erected with all the greater care, because of the stronger powers by which we are attacked. 15. Medicine once consisted of the knowledge of a few simples, to stop the flow of blood, or to heal wounds; then by degrees it reached its present stage of complicated variety. No wonder that in early days medicine had less to do! Men's bodies were still sound and strong; their food was light and not spoiled by art and luxury, whereas when they began to seek dishes not for the sake of removing, but of rousing, the appetite, and devised countless sauces to whet their gluttony, – then what before was nourishment to a hungry man became a burden to the full stomach.


The illustrious founder of the guild and profession of medicine remarked that women never lost their hair or suffered from pain in the feet; and yet nowadays they run short of hair and are afflicted with gout. This does not mean that woman's physique has changed, but that it has been conquered; in rivalling male indulgences they have also rivalled the ills to which men are heirs.


The halls of the professor and the philosopher are deserted; but what a crowd there is in the cafés! How many young fellows besiege the kitchens of their gluttonous friends! 24.


A man may know that he should fight for his country, but fear will dissuade him. A man may know that he should sweat forth his last drop of energy on behalf of his friends, but luxury will forbid. A man may know that keeping a mistress is the worst kind of insult to his wife, but lust will drive him in the opposite direction. 38. It will therefore be of no avail to give precepts unless you first remove the conditions that are likely to stand in the way of precepts; it will do no more good than to place weapons by your side and bring yourself near the foe without having your hands free to use those weapons.


I grant you that, if warned, a man will do what he should; but that is not enough, since the credit lies, not in the actual deed, but in the way it is done.


Precepts are commonly given as to how the gods should be worshipped. But let us forbid lamps to be lighted on the Sabbath, since the gods do not need light, neither do men take pleasure in soot. Let us forbid men to offer morning salutation and to throng the doors of temples; mortal ambitions are attracted by such ceremonies, but God is worshipped by those who truly know Him.


God seeks no servants. Of course not; he himself does service to mankind, everywhere and to all he is at hand to help.

Our relations with one another are like a stone arch, which would collapse if the stones did not mutually support each other, and which is upheld in this very way.


Now all the things which cause us to groan or recoil, are part of the tax of life – things, my dear Lucilius, which you should never hope and never seek to escape.


A long life includes all these troubles, just as a long journey includes dust and mud and rain.

You need never believe that anyone who depends upon happiness is happy! It is a fragile support – this delight in adventitious things; the joy which entered from without will some day depart. But that joy which springs wholly from oneself is leal and sound; it increases and attends us to the last; while all other things which provoke the admiration of the crowd are but temporary Goods.


All things that Fortune looks upon become productive and pleasant, only if he who possesses them is in possession also of himself, and is not in the power of that which belongs to him.

to keep in memory the things we have lost, and not to suffer the enjoyment which we have derived from them to pass away along with them. To have may be taken from us, to have had, never. A man is thankless in the highest degree if, after losing something, he feels no obligation for having received it. Chance robs us of the thing, but leaves us its use and its enjoyment – and we have lost this if we are so unfair as to regret.


elder Sextius rejected the honours of office; he was born with an obligation to take part in public affairs, and yet would not accept the broad stripe even when the deified Julius offered it to him. For he understood that what can be given can also be taken away.


How much of this time is taken up with weeping, how much with worry! How much with prayers for death before death arrives, how much with our health, how much with our fears! How much is occupied by our years of inexperience or of useless endeavour! And half of all this time is wasted in sleeping.

Every day and every hour reveal to us what a nothing we are, and remind us with some fresh evidence that we have forgotten our weakness; then, as we plan for eternity, they compel us to look over our shoulders at Death.


As the mother's womb holds us for ten months, making us ready, not for the womb itself, but for the existence into which we seem to be sent forth when at last we are fitted to draw breath and live in the open; just so, throughout the years extending between infancy and old age, we are making ourselves ready for another birth. A different beginning, a different condition, await us.


Nature strips you as bare at your departure as at your entrance.


You may take away no more than you brought in; what is more, you must throw away the major portion of that which you brought with you into life: you will be stripped of the very skin which covers you – that which has been your last protection; you will be stripped of the flesh, and lose the blood which is suffuses and circulated through your body; you will be stripped of bones and sinews, the framework of these transitory and feeble parts.


Consider how much we are helped by good example; you will thus understand that the presence of a noble man is of no less service than his memory.


You may deem official position a good; you will be vexed at another's appointment or re-appointment to the consulship; you will be jealous whenever you see a name several times in the state records. Your ambition will be so frenzied that you will regard yourself last in the race if there is anyone in front of you.

Next came the prison, and the cup of poison. But all these measures changed the soul of Socrates so little that they did not even change his features. What wonderful and rare distinction! He maintained this attitude up to the very end, and no man ever saw Socrates too much elated or too much depressed. Amid all the disturbance of Fortune, he was undisturbed.


Reflect on the things which goad man into destroying man: you will find that they are hope, envy, hatred, fear, and contempt.

No man will keep to himself what he hears. No one will tell another only as much as he has heard. And he who tells tales will tell names, too. Everyone has someone to whom he entrusts exactly what has been entrusted to him.


Whoever expects punishment, receives it, but whoever deserves it, expects it.


My tardiness in answering your letter was not due to press of business. Do not listen to that sort of excuse; I am at liberty, and so is anyone else who wishes to be at liberty. No man is at the mercy of affairs. He gets entangled in them of his own accord, and then flatters himself that being busy is a proof of happiness.

Absorb not all that you wish, but all that you can hold. Only be of a sound mind, and then you will be able to hold all that you wish. For the more the mind receives, the more does it expand.

a sea-sick pilot can be efficient in a storm. He must hold the tiller when the waves are tossing him; he must wrestle, as it were, with the sea; he must furl his sails when the storm rages; what good is a frightened and vomiting steersman to me? And how much greater, think you, is the storm of life than that which tosses any ship! One must steer, not talk.


Good men are mutually helpful; for each gives practice to the other's virtues and thus maintains wisdom at its proper level. Each needs someone with whom he may make comparisons and investigations. 2. Skilled wrestlers are kept up to the mark by practice; a musician is stirred to action by one of equal proficiency. The wise man also needs to have his virtues kept in action; and as he prompts himself to do things, so is he prompted by another wise man. 3. How can a wise man help another wise man? He can quicken his impulses, and point out to him opportunities for honourable action. Besides, he can develop some of his own ideas; he can impart what he has discovered. For even in the case of the wise man something will always remain to discover, something towards which his mind may make new ventures.


a good man will help another good man. "How?" you ask. 5. Because he will bring joy to the other, he will strengthen his faith, and from the contemplation of their mutual tranquillity the delight of both will be increased. Moreover they will communicate to each other a knowledge of certain facts; for the wise man is not all-knowing. And even if he were all-knowing, someone might be able to devise and point out short cuts, by which the whole matter is more readily disseminated. 6. The wise will help the wise, not, mark you, because of his own strength merely, but because of the strength of the man whom he assists.

heat is not helped by the addition of further heat, in order to be hot; but the wise man cannot maintain his mental standard without intercourse with friends of his own kind – with whom he may share his goodness.


Helping, however, really means prompting the soul in accordance with Nature, both by the prompter's excellence and by the excellence of him who is thus prompted. And this cannot take place without advantage to the helper also. For in training the excellence of another, a man must necessarily train his own.


the wise man will, in company with his fellow sage, confirm the truth of that most sweet and honourable proverb – "always desiring and always refusing the same things": it will be a noble result when they draw the load "with equal yoke."


But there is no reason why you should flatter yourself over-much if you despise gilded couches and jewelled furniture. For what virtue lies in despising useless things?


We should satisfy our stomachs without being over-nice. How does it matter what the stomach receives, since it must lose whatever it has received?


Did we gather merely to learn what greed was? For my own part I left the place with less craving than I had when I entered. I came to despise riches, not because of their uselessness, but because of their pettiness.


"all the arts also are living things, and all our thoughts and all that the mind comprehends. It therefore follows that many thousands of living things dwell in man's tiny heart, and that each individual among us consists of, or at least contains, many living beings."


God has created all the great number of leaves that we behold: each, however, is stamped with its special pattern. All the many animals: none resembles another in size – always some difference! The Creator has set himself the task of making unlike and unequal things that are different; but all the virtues, as your argument states, are equal. Therefore, they are not living things.


wise silence is a Good, and so is a frugal dinner;


Those who wish their virtue to be advertised are not striving for virtue but for renown. Are you not willing to be just without being renowned? Nay, indeed you must often be just and be at the same time disgraced. And then, if you are wise, let ill repute, well won, be a delight. Farewell.


"Man's speech is just like his life."


no man's ability has ever been approved without something being pardoned. Show me any man, however famous; I can tell you what it was that his age forgave in him, and what it was that his age purposely overlooked.


I will show you persons of the highest reputation, set up as models for our admiration; and yet if you seek to correct their errors, you destroy them; for vices are so intertwined with virtues that they drag the virtues along with them.


Whenever you notice a style that is too careful and too polished, you may be sure that the mind also is no less absorbed in petty things. The really great man speaks informally and easily; whatever he says, he speaks with assurance rather than with pains.


Style is the garb of thought: if it be trimmed, or dyed, or treated, it shows that there are defects and a certain amount of flaws in the mind. Elaborate elegance is not a manly garb.


There is none of us, I declare to you, who would not burn with love for this vision of virtue, if only he had the privilege of beholding it; for now there are many things that cut off our vision, piercing it with too strong a light, or clogging it with too much darkness. If, however, as certain drugs are wont to be used for sharpening and clearing the eyesight, we are likewise willing to free our mind's eye from hindrances, we shall then be able to perceive virtue, though it be buried in the body – even though poverty stand in the way, and even though lowliness and disgrace block the path.


like children who regard every toy as a thing of value, who cherish necklaces bought at the price of a mere penny as more dear than their parents or than their brothers. And what, then, as Aristo says, is the difference between ourselves and these children, except that we elders go crazy over paintings and sculpture, and that our folly costs us dearer?


Our parents have instilled into us a respect for gold and silver; in our early years the craving has been implanted, settling deep within us and growing with our growth. Then too the whole nation, though at odds on every other subject, agrees upon this; this is what they regard, this is what they ask for their children, this is what they dedicate to the gods when they wish to show their gratitude – as if it were the greatest of all man's possessions! And finally, public opinion has come to such a pass that poverty is a hissing and a reproach, despised by the rich and loathed by the poor.


There is no vice which lacks some plea; there is no vice that at the start is not modest and easily entreated; but afterwards the trouble spreads more widely. If you allow it to begin, you cannot make sure of its ceasing.


Every emotion at the start is weak. Afterwards, it rouses itself and gains strength by progress; it is more easy to forestall it than to forgo it. Who does not admit that all the emotions flow as it were from a certain natural source? We are endowed by Nature with an interest in our own well-being; but this very interest, when overindulged, becomes a vice. Nature has intermingled pleasure with necessary things – not in order that we should seek pleasure, but in order that the addition of pleasure may make the indispensable means of existence attractive to our eyes. Should it claim rights of its own, it is luxury.


Let us therefore resist these faults when they are demanding entrance, because, as I have said, it is easier to deny them admittance than to make them depart. 4. And if you cry: "One should be allowed a certain amount of grieving, and a certain amount of fear." I reply that the "certain amount" can be too long-drawn-out, and that it will refuse to stop short when you so desire. The wise man can safely control himself without becoming over-anxious; he can halt his tears and his pleasures at will; but in our case, because it is not easy to retrace our steps, it is best not to push ahead at


whether the wise man should become a lover: "As to the wise man, we shall see later; but you and I, who are as yet far removed from wisdom, should not trust ourselves to fall into a state that is disordered, uncontrolled, enslaved to another, contemptible to itself. If our love be not spurned, we are excited by its kindness; if it be scorned, we are kindled by our pride. An easily won love hurts us as much as one which is difficult to win; we are captured by that which is compliant, and we struggle with that which is hard. Therefore, knowing our weakness, let us remain quiet. Let us not expose this unstable spirit to the temptations of drink, or beauty, or flattery, or anything that coaxes and allures."


let us step back from slippery places; even on dry ground it is hard enough to take a sturdy stand.


We mortals have been endowed with sufficient strength by nature, if only we use this strength, if only we concentrate our powers and rouse them all to help us or at least not to hinder us. The reason is unwillingness, the excuse, inability.


But it is preferable to deal with one's own ills, rather than with another's – to sift oneself and see for how many vain things one is a candidate, and cast a vote for none of them. 3. This, my dear Lucilius, is a noble thing, this brings peace and freedom – to canvass for nothing, and to pass by all the elections of Fortune.


You deem lofty the objects you seek, because you are on a low level and hence far away from them; but they are mean in the sight of him who has reached them. And I am very much mistaken if he does not desire to climb still higher; that which you regard as the top is merely a rung on the ladder. 7. Now all men suffer from ignorance of the truth; deceived by common report, they make for these ends as if they were good, and then, after having won their wish, and suffered much, they find them evil, or empty, or less important than they had expected. Most men admire that which deceives them at a distance, and by the crowd good things are supposed to be big things.


"That which attracts and calls the spirit to itself is a Good." But the objection at once comes up – what if it does attract, but straight to ruin? You know how seductive many evils are. That which is true differs from that which looks like the truth; hence the Good is connected with the true, for it is not good unless it is also true. But that which attracts and allures, is only like the truth; it steals your attention, demands your interest, and draws you to itself. 9. Therefore, some have given this definition: "That is good which inspires desire for itself, or rouses towards itself the impulse of a struggling soul." There is the same objection to this idea; for many things rouse the soul's impulses, and yet the search for them is harmful to the seeker. The following definition is better: "That is good which rouses the soul's impulse towards itself in accordance with nature, and is worth seeking only when it begins to be thoroughly worth seeking." It is by this time an honourable thing; for that is a thing completely worth seeking.


A person, once a child, becomes a youth; his peculiar quality is transformed; for the child could not reason, but the youth possesses reason.


And why does the last addition, although very slight, make a great deal of difference? Because it does not increase; it fills up.

Imagine, Ananda, a cesspool, of a man’s depth, brimful of dung and a man fallen in, head and all—though a man appear, ready to help, to do the friendly, to set him in safety, to lift him out; yet were he to go all round that cesspool, he would not see even the prick-end of a horse-hair of that man unsmeared with dung by which to grasp and lift him out.

## As One Is: To Free the Mind from All Condition: To Free the Mind from All Conditioning, Jiddu Krishnamurti


To stand alone is to be uncorrupted, innocent, free of all tradition, of dogma, of opinion, of what another says, and so on. Such a mind does not seek because there is nothing to seek; being free, such a mind is completely still without a want, without movement. But this state is not to be achieved; it isn’t a thing that you buy through discipline; it doesn’t come into being by giving up sex, or practicing a certain yoga. It comes into being only when there is understanding of the ways of the self, the ‘me’, which shows itself through the conscious mind in everyday activity, and also in the unconscious. What matters is to understand for oneself, not through the direction of others, the total content of consciousness, which is conditioned, which is the result of society, of religion, of various impacts, impressions, memories—to understand all that conditioning and be free of it. But there is no “how” to be free. If you ask how to be free, you are not listening.1


But what is needed, I think, is a patience and a perseverance to seek without an end.


And it is one of the most difficult things to free the mind from this desire to find a result.


Everyone throughout the world, surely, is trying to condition the mind in a better way, and there is never a question of freeing the mind from all conditioning.


But it is only the mind that is capable of patiently observing its own conditioning and being free from its conditioning—it is only such a mind that is able to have a revolution, a radical transformation, and thereby to discover that which is infinitely beyond the mind, beyond all our desires, our vanities and pursuits.


What is listening?


difference between attention and concentration.


To know oneself is to observe what one thinks, how one feels, not just superficially, but to be deeply aware of what is without condemnation, without judgment, without evaluation or comparison.


So the mind is conditioned right through; there is no part of the mind which is not conditioned, and our problem is: Can such a mind free itself? And who is the entity that can free it?


The mind can be free only when it is completely still. Though it has problems, innumerable urges, conflicts, ambitions, if—through self-knowledge, through watching itself without acceptance or condemnation—the mind is choicelessly aware of its own process, then out of that awareness there comes an astonishing silence, a quietness of the mind in which there is no movement of any kind. It


You may be socially prosperous, you may have innumerable possessions, cars, houses, refrigerators, superficial peace, but unless that which is measureless comes into being, there will always be sorrow.


It is really very interesting to watch one’s mind in operation.


We want to retain pleasure and discard pain, but desire creates both, does it not?


The mind that gives soil to problems can never find that which is real. So the issue is not how to resolve desire but to understand it, and one can understand it only when there is no condemnation of it. Only the mind that is not occupied with desire can understand desire.

On the whole Nur Jahan’s role in government was positive.

Of the 10.1 million net new jobs the United States added from May 2012 to May 2016, only 5 percent, or 541,000, are in the computing sector. Being able to write business software, run a computer network, or create a smartphone app has turned out to be the answer for less than one-tenth of job hunters.

A liberal arts education is hardly the only way to master such challenges. Keep the number of unknowns under control, and a specialist’s background in business or engineering may prove better. Graduates from either of those programs are well-trained problem solvers too. The foundations of critical thinking aren’t monastic secrets unknown outside the humanities and social sciences. Yet in the most turbulent fields, everything is in flux and nobody’s model works perfectly. When the extent of what’s unknown hasn’t been established, the fluidity and highly developed lateral thinking of liberal arts training can carry the day. A background in the humanities and social sciences helps you get comfortable working with scanty data when nothing better is available. You become good at building provisional inferences when others are stuck. Often your early guesses prove right, making you unusually good at spotting emerging patterns before others do.

Who was earning at least a hundred thousand dollars a year? And who felt fundamentally satisfied with the way everything in life (family, health, peace of mind) had worked out? With the other half of his survey, Detweiler asked respondents to recall their actual day-to-day habits during college. Who studied a lot? Who was deeply involved in extracurricular activities? Who spent a lot of time talking about social issues with friends? Who got to know classmates with radically different attitudes and backgrounds? And who got to know professors outside of class? All told, Detweiler tracked nearly a dozen important ways that his respondents’ college experiences might have varied. Data in hand, Detweiler began looking for the top performers’ unique edge. The factor that caught his eye: building a close affinity with at least a few professors. About one-third of his respondents had made an extra effort to stop by for office hours, to meet for lunch—and to ask for professors’ job tips, life advice, and other pointers that deepened the mentor-protégé relationship. The payoff: Students who sought out faculty mentors had a 28 percent higher chance of getting a better-than-average first job after graduation. Later on, these graduates were nearly twice as likely to end up in leadership positions. Generally, they felt more fulfilled in life. And they were more likely to be seen as mentors to others.

## The Story of the Red Fort, Swapna Dutta


It might also interest you to know that there used to be a village called Indarpat in the very place where the original Indraprastha was supposed to be located. The village Indarpat remained until the beginning of the twentieth century. It was demolished along with many other villages when the British capital of New Delhi came to be built. An inscription in Sanskrit found near the original Indarpat mentions Indraprastha. The inscription is now in the Red Fort Museum.


Pandavas (who were the legitimate heirs) asked for five villages for themselves. The names of these five villages end with pat (the Hindi equivalent of Sanskrit prastha). They were Indarpat, Baghpat, Tilpat, Sonepat, and Panipat.


For some strange reason kings belonging to different dynasties (or sometimes from the same dynasty, as in the case of the Tughluqs) who came to Delhi preferred to build their own capital in a different part of the city rather than reside and renovate the existing capital. When shifting to another location they often demolished the existing buildings and used up the material for building new ones.

Here I shall raise a mighty fort which will be the envy, of our friends and the despair of our foes.”


The six main palaces were built just behind the Diwan-i-Am. Only five of these palaces remain now. The first is the Mumtaz Mahal. The building is now the Delhi Museum of Archaeology, which is known for its rare Mughal exhibits.


The new city was seven miles in circumference. It was surrounded on three sides with a high and massive wall that had a broad parapet.

## In Defense of a Liberal Education, Zakaria


We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely.—E. O. Wilson


In an age defined by technology and globalization, everyone is talking about skills-based learning. Politicians, businesspeople, and even many educators see it as the only way for the nation to stay competitive. They urge students to stop dreaming and start thinking practically about the skills they will need in the workplace. An open-ended exploration of knowledge is seen as a road to nowhere.


A majority is specializing in fields because they see them as directly related to the job market. It’s true that more Americans need technical training, and all Americans need greater scientific literacy. But the drumbeat of talk about skills and jobs has not lured people into engineering and biology—not everyone has the aptitude for science—so much as it has made them nervously forsake the humanities and take courses in business and communications. Many of these students might well have been better off taking a richer, deeper set of courses in subjects they found fascinating—and supplementing it, as we all should, with some basic knowledge of computers and math.

democracy,” the Athenian statesman Pericles noted in his funeral oration, “because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the whole people.” This innovation in government required a simultaneous innovation in education. Basic skills for sustenance were no longer sufficient—citizens also had to be properly trained to run their own society. The link between a broad education and liberty became important to the Greeks. Describing this approach to instruction centuries later, the Romans coined a term for it: a “liberal” education, using the word liberal in its original Latin sense, “of or pertaining to free men.”


The Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, one of the earliest writers on record to use the term artes liberales, wanted to combine the search for truth with rhetoric, which was seen as a more useful skill. “For it is from knowledge that oratory must derive its beauty and fullness,” the philosopher-statesman wrote around 55 AD.


These scholars came from great distances and were often grouped by their geographical origins, each one being called a “nation,” an early use of the word. Some of these “nations” hired local scholars, administered exams, and joined together into groups that came to be called universitas. These


colleges were defined by their architecture. An imposing stone building was usually constructed with an open courtyard in the center and student dormitories arrayed around it. The “common” room was where students could meet, the chapel where they could pray, and the library where they could read. This model of a residential college originated in England and spread to the Anglo-American world, where it remains the distinctive form for undergraduates.


The residential college has come to be seen as possessing certain qualities that enhance the experience of liberal education beyond the curriculum. The advantages of such an arrangement are often described today in terms like “living-learning experiences,” “peer-to-peer education,” and “lateral learning.” Samuel Eliot Morison, the legendary historian of Harvard, best described the distinctive benefits of the residential setting: “Book learning alone might be got by lectures and reading; but it was only by studying and disputing, eating and drinking, playing and praying as members of the same collegiate community, in close and constant association with each other and with their tutors, that the priceless gift of character could be imparted.”


The Yale report explained that the essence of liberal education was “not to teach that which is peculiar to any one of the professions; but to lay the foundation which is common to them all.” It

There are also social benefits to a common core. All students are able to share an intellectual experience. They can discuss it together, join in its delights, and commiserate over its weaknesses. It’s ultimately a bonding opportunity. “Once they have gone through the Core,” writes Delbanco, referring to Columbia’s program specifically, “no student is a complete stranger to any other.” That sense of being part of a larger group becomes even more useful later in life, when one is expected to work with one’s peers and colleagues toward common goals in a professional setting.


one can always read a book to get the basic information about a particular topic, or simply use Google. The crucial challenge is to learn how to read critically, analyze data, and formulate ideas—and most of all to enjoy the intellectual adventure enough to be able to do them easily and often.


Another development, again unrelated to any intellectual theory about liberal education, has been the abandonment of rigor, largely in the humanities. Grades have risen steadily in almost all American colleges in recent decades.


I can attest from personal experience that handing out high marks can be convenient for faculty interests. When I was a teaching assistant at Harvard, I quickly realized that giving B minuses or below meant that the students would come to complain at length; ask you to reconsider, maybe give them another chance to do the work over; and even raise the issue with their advisor or a dean. It meant lots of work for me. The much easier strategy was to give everyone a B plus or an A minus, reserving the straight A for works of genuine distinction.


The most interesting and ambitious effort to reform liberal education for the twenty-first century is not taking place in America. In fact, it is taking place about as far away from the United States as one can possibly get—Singapore. In 2011, Yale University joined with the National University of Singapore to establish a new liberal arts school in Asia called Yale-NUS College,


The Yale-NUS report states that the college wants to make “articulate communication” central to its intellectual experience. That involves writing, of course, but also the ability to give compelling verbal explanations of, say, scientific experiments or to deliver presentations before small and large groups. At the deepest level, articulate communication helps you to speak your mind. This doesn’t mean spouting anything and everything you’re thinking at any given moment. It means learning to understand your own mind, to filter out under-developed ideas, and then to express to the outside world your thoughts, arranged in some logical order.


strength of a liberal education: it teaches you how to learn.


Whatever job you take, the specific subjects you studied in college will probably prove somewhat irrelevant to the day-to-day work you will do soon after you graduate. And even if they are relevant, that will change. People who learned to write code for computers just ten years ago now confront a new world of apps and mobile devices. What remain constant are the skills you acquire and the methods you learn to approach problems. Given how quickly industries and professions are evolving these days, you will need to apply these skills to new challenges all the time. Learning and re-learning, tooling and retooling are at the heart of the modern economy.


Drew Faust, president of Harvard University, has pointed out that a liberal education should give people the skills “that will help them get ready for their sixth job, not their first job.”


Thomas Cech—Nobel Prize–winning chemist and graduate of Grinnell College, a classic liberal arts school—makes a sports analogy to illustrate a similar insight. Just as athletes do exercises unrelated to their own sport, so students should study fields outside their academic area of focus. “Cross-training may exercise key muscle groups more effectively than spending the same amount of time working out in the sport of interest,”


Gardner argues that in the future, students will focus even more on modes of thinking. After all, with facts being just a Google search away, why waste brain cells memorizing them? He notes that the best thinking often happens when ideas, fields, and disciplines collide, in a setting where cultures rub up against one another.

who are more inclined to obtain some kind of skills-based training than a liberal education. Perhaps those people would be better off learning a specific technical skill rather than enrolling in a preprofessional-sounding major like “business.” But for those who do find that their passion is art history or anthropology, and take it seriously, there are real rewards in the outside world. Both those fields often require the intensive study of several languages and cultures, experience working in foreign countries, an eye for aesthetics, and the ability to translate from one medium or culture to another. Most of these skills could be useful in any number of professions in today’s globalized age. They force you to look at people and objects from a variety of perspectives. As Howard Gardner’s research demonstrates, this kind of exposure trains various kinds of intelligence, making you a more creative and aware person.


In 2013, the American Association of Colleges and Universities published a survey showing that 74 percent of employers would recommend a good liberal education to students as the best way to prepare for today’s global economy. When students graduate, those with engineering degrees start out with higher salaries—as they should, given that they possess a tangible skill-set that can be instantly applied within a company. But over time, the wage gap between engineers and other professionals narrows, especially for liberal arts students who go on to get a professional degree. In fact, one recent study found that students from a set of liberal arts colleges were more likely than their peers at other institutions of higher education to obtain doctorates in sciences, presumably because they possess an acute curiosity and sense of academic adventure.


India has a long tradition of liberal arts colleges and universities, many dating to the British era and some to the period after independence, like Jawaharlal Nehru University. But none of these institutions are as prestigious as the country’s engineering schools. In addition, all are run like the government bureaucracies that they are. Looking to shake up the old system, in recent years, several prominent Indian businessmen have set up new higher-learning institutions oriented toward the liberal arts, such as Azim Premji University and Mahindra United World College. In addition, Ashoka and Nalanda Universities, both of which welcomed their first class of students in 2014, hearken back to India’s ancient heritage of philosophy, literature, science, and ethics but in a modern liberal arts and sciences form.


The Triple Package,


The United States has a poorly trained labor force in general, which is a disadvantage. But it makes up for it in several ways. The country has an extremely dynamic and flexible economy, strong rule of law, a good regulatory structure, extraordinary research universities, rich venture-capital firms, and a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. All these ingredients more than make up for middling test scores. Japan, on the other hand, has a superbly trained general population. But it would score poorly on many broader economic and cultural indicators, especially with regard to entrepreneurship and the hierarchy of society. Good test scores are not enough to create the next Google.

Jefferson was one of the earliest proponents of electives, believing that students should practice the same freedom at school that they were allowed in a democracy.


Jefferson’s prose differed. He often wrote about the need to create a “natural aristocracy.” While this sounds like a plan for a House of Lords, Jefferson in fact intended the opposite. His “natural aristocracy” was based strictly on merit, to be refreshed constantly, as opposed to an “unnatural aristocracy,” based on birth, wealth, and privilege. Jefferson believed that all societies inevitably have elites—someone, in other words, has to be on top—but that America’s elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. “The best geniuses will be raked from the rubbish annually,” he wrote.


many have created the “party pathway,” described in Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton’s book Paying for the Party, in which an increasing number of rich out-of-state kids who can pay full tuition get relaxed admissions criteria, special majors, inflated grades, and fancy facilities. The bright low-income students, who are on the “mobility pathway,” get none of this. Facing academic, economic, and social pressures, they have a higher burnout and dropout rate. Those who graduate do so with a mountain of debt.


Measuring the quality of education turns out to be extremely complicated. Most colleges are judged by a variety of factors, including resources, faculty, and facilities. Chief among them, though, is the average SAT score of entering freshmen. Yet the test scores used in admissions are a measure of what colleges take in, not what they produce. The fact that an Ivy League school has freshmen with high SAT scores tells us that it is a good magnet for talent but nothing else. What should matter is how students, including those with low SAT scores, improve over the course of their time in school. But what is the measure by which to judge that improvement? Academically Adrift, the book mentioned in the last chapter, has brought this issue to the national fore. Using the Collegiate Learning Assessment test, the book’s authors found that 45 percent of students showed no improvement in critical thinking in their first two years of college. Subsequent tests have demonstrated that this pattern continues in their junior and senior years as well.


We learn today in ways that would seem largely familiar to the ancient Greeks. A teacher stands in front of a group of students and lectures them, at times involving them in discussion. All the revolutions in information technology in recent decades have had hardly any effect on this basic mechanism, or on the fundamental operations of schools, colleges, and universities.

Stamenka Uvalić-Trumbić, an education expert formerly with UNESCO, noted in 2011 that the number of people enrolled in higher education across the world was 165 million. At current growth rates, that number would reach 263 million in 2025. But it will be impossible to get to those numbers using the present system of education. “Accommodating the additional 98 million students would require more than four major universities (30,000 students) to open every week for the next fifteen years,” Uvalić-Trumbić explained. That pace of expansion is not happening anywhere.


Even in China, where the government has made a major commitment to enlarging access to higher education, the number of students is growing at a much faster rate than the number of faculty and facilities. “Inevitably, the greatest impact of MOOCs will be in the developing world, where it will be possible for millions to get educated who simply would not have otherwise,” says Richard Levin, the CEO of Coursera.

When I visit developing countries, nearly everywhere I find they are run more effectively today than they were decades ago. Those at the helm of economic policy are almost invariably graduates of programs in economics from Western universities. They studied at, say, the University of Chicago, or Georgetown, or the London School of Economics, and then returned to their central banks and finance ministries to implement some of what they had learned. Health care is being provided in a more systematic and thoughtful way, based on ideas that have been tried and proved elsewhere.


ONE OF THE enduring benefits of a liberal education is that it broadens us. When we absorb great literature, we come face to face with ideas, experiences, and emotions that we might never otherwise encounter in our lifetime. When we read history, we encounter people from a different age and learn from their triumphs and travails. When we study physics and biology, we comprehend the mysteries of the universe and human life. And when we listen to great music, we are moved in ways that reason cannot comprehend. This may not help make a living, but it will help make a life. We all play many roles, professional and personal, in one lifetime. A liberal education gives us a greater capacity to be good workers, but it will also give us the capacity to be good partners, friends, parents, and citizens.


The notion that young people are somehow callow and morally unserious is not a new charge. In 700 BC, the Greek poet Hesiod wrote about it. The philosophers Xenophon and Plato were dismayed by the moral decay of their youth. The Romans saw loss of virtue all around them. The


You can’t help but sympathize with the sophomore who said to me, “I think that whatever we did, we would be falling short by some measure—and people would write about that.”


it’s strange to blame the students for something that is largely beyond their control. After all, they did not devise the intense system of tests that comprise the gateway to American higher education, nor did they create the highly competitive job market in anxious economic times.


Those were times when large institutions—private and public—dominated life. They were powerful and stable, and they looked after individuals for their entire careers. Your task was to fit in, to put the interest of the institution above your own, to be a good team player. Then you would be rewarded with security and success. (Marshall was subsequently appointed secretary of state, then secretary of defense.) Today, everyone is told, that compact has been broken. Everything is in flux. You must be entrepreneurial and recognize that you will need to change jobs and even careers over a lifetime. No company will stay loyal to you, nor can you lock yourself into one place.


The Start-up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform Your Career,


Because of the times we live in, all of us, young and old, do not spend enough time and effort thinking about the meaning of life. We do not look inside of ourselves enough to understand our strengths and weaknesses, and we do not look around enough—at the world, in history—to ask the deepest and broadest questions. The solution surely is that, even now, we could all use a little bit more of a liberal education.


## India in the Persianate Age, 1000–1765, Richard M. Eaton


Sultan Iltutmish, for all his rhetoric of being India’s sole legitimate Muslim ruler, continued to issue coins with the old bull-and-horseman motif and a Sanskritized form of his name and title: Suratana Śri Samsadina, the latter referring to his given name, Shams al-Din. He also enlarged Delhi’s Qutb mosque by three times in order to accommodate the many immigrants from beyond the Khyber who had flocked to Delhi during his reign. And he added three storeys to the city’s famous minaret, the Qutb Minar. Notably, he placed a seven-metre iron pillar in the centre of the mosque’s oldest courtyard, on a direct axis with its main prayer chamber. Originally installed in a Vishnu temple to announce the military victories of a fourth-or fifth-century Indian king, the pillar was now associated with Iltutmish and his own victories. In transplanting the pillar in this way, the sultan broke with Islamic architectural conventions while conforming to Indian political traditions.


Ulugh Khan’s policy of creating a personal support base composed of uprooted outsiders was hardly unique in the history of the Delhi sultanate. Empowering people of humble origins and placing them in contexts alien to their social background ensured their dependence on their masters. As a Central Asian Turk who himself had experienced the life of a deracinated outsider in the court of Delhi, Ulugh Khan clearly understood the merits of this strategy.


in order to clear the thick forests between the Jamuna and the Ganges. In this he aimed both to remove the physical cover of suspected rebels and to open up new lands for arable agriculture, which in turn expanded the agrarian economy and the state’s revenue base.


These policies encouraged the emergence of rural networks of commercial exchange that linked the countryside more tightly with urban centres. Such market towns, or qasbahs, would provide the true foundation of the sultanate, firmly rooting it in India’s economy, society and culture. By the early fourteenth century, the areas most directly affected by Balban’s forest-clearing operations had become so prosperous that their revenues were reserved for the state, and not entrusted to nobles.


Despite their possession of worldly might, sultans could only envy the popularity of charismatic shaikhs who were widely believed to possess miraculous powers


Pandit Yogishvara preceded the particulars regarding the well with a flowery panegyric to the reigning monarch identical to those that Brahmins had for centuries been using for their Hindu royal patrons. He mentions not only the reigning sovereign, Sultan Balban, but the entire line of rulers, both Turkish and Indian, who had reigned over the Delhi region in the preceding several centuries: Salutation to Ganapati. Om. Salutation to Śiva … The land of Hariyanaka [upper India] was first enjoyed by the Tomaras and then by the Cauhanas. It is now ruled by the Shaka [‘ Scythian’, or Central Asian] kings. First came Shahabadina [Shihab al-Din (i.e. Muhammad) Ghuri], then Khudavadina [Qutb al-Din Aibek], master of the earth … In his [Sultan Balban’s] kingdom, abounding in benign rule, extending from Gauda [Bengal] to Gajjana [Ghazni], from the Dravida region [south India] and from the Setubandha [to the north] where the entire region was filled with inner content, the earth bore vernal floral charms produced by the rays of the innumerable precious stones and corals which dropped on it from the crowns of the bent heads of the rulers who came from every direction for his service. He, whose legions daily traversed for a bath the earth both eastward to the confluence of the Ganges with the [Bay of Bengal] and westward to the confluence of the Indus with the sea … The dust raised by the hooves of whose cavalry marching ahead of his army stops the enemies in front. He, the central gem in the pearl necklace of the seven-sea-girt earth, Nayaka Śri Hammira Gayasidina [Ghiyath al-Din Balban], the king and the emperor reigns supreme … When he went forth on a military expedition, the Gaudas [Bengalis] abdicated their glory; the Andhras through fear sought the shelter of holes, the Keralas forsook their pleasures; the Karnatas hid themselves in caves; the Maharashtras gave up their places; the


From this ‘worm’s-eye’ perspective of Delhi’s ruling class, it meant nothing that the sultan was Muslim and Yogishvara a Hindu; what mattered was that the people who produced this text viewed their rulers in Delhi as legitimate and protective.


From the vantage point of a more distant, bird’s-eye perspective, however, the inscription suggests how far the Persian and the Sanskrit worlds had already begun to overlap and even penetrate each other. Even though Balban’s chroniclers might clothe his regime in a Persianate discourse of worldly power or in an Islamic one of pious rectitude, unbeknownst to the court, and located only twelve kilometres from his palace, the sultan and his regime were perceived–literally inscribed–within a Sanskrit discourse of worldly power and moral authority.


They also trumpeted a narrative of Muslim invaders triumphantly vanquishing a mass of Indian infidels. But such rhetoric stood at odds with the practice of the Delhi sultanate’s rulers, who needed to govern a huge population accustomed to their own ways of managing affairs. Overruling objections from their more conservative Muslim advisers, they followed the policies of their Ghaznavid and Ghurid predecessors by integrating defeated Indian elites into their political systems and aligning their coinage with indigenous numismatic traditions.


Mongol catastrophe in Central Asia and Khurasan drove thousands of uprooted scholars, soldiers, administrators, Sufis and artisans into the welcoming arms of the fledgling Delhi sultanate. By then a substantial canon of Persian literary works had already emerged73 that would now spread throughout South Asia, which soon became a major centre in its own right for the production, and not just the reception, of Persianate culture. Over the course of the next six centuries, India–not Iran–would become the world’s principal centre for the production of Persian dictionaries. 74


The first major anthology of Persian poetry would be compiled not in Central Asia or the Iranian plateau, but in southern Punjab at the court of Muhammad of Ghur’s former slave, Nasir al-Din Qubacha.


even if the Delhi sultanate was never the unified monolith that its chroniclers might have imagined, the state established by Aibek and consolidated by Iltutmish planted in India the idea of the sultanate as a new and powerful system of governance. This idea would prove to be contagious, as various actors sought to replicate it in regions very far from Delhi. It


Sultan balban


Like Mahmud of Ghazni’s raids on north India two centuries earlier, these were aimed at plunder, not the annexation of territory. But whereas Mahmud’s booty was used to finance conquests far to the west, ‘Ala al-Din’s Deccan raids were aimed at financing north India’s defence from Mongol invasions, just as Balban had recommended. Like Mahmud’s raids, too, those of ‘Ala al-Din were launched nearly every other year over the span of a decade, penetrating ever deeper into the peninsula: Gujarat in 1297, northern Rajasthan in 1299–1301, southern Rajasthan in 1302–03, Malwa in 1305, Maharashtra in 1307, Andhra in 1309 and both Karnataka and Madurai in 1311.

kings whose territories lay in the path of the advancing Tughluq army were liable to be destroyed, as happened at Warangal. But any structure brought within the orbit of sovereign territory, such as Kalyana’s Śiva temple, was understood as state property and therefore subject to government protection, provided its local patrons remained loyal to the state.


Muhammad bin tugalaq


Six years after Ibn Battuta’s arrival, he abolished all taxes beyond legal alms and distributed food to the people of Delhi for six months. At court he would patiently hear the complaints of distressed people. The


Already by the twelfth century, and possibly earlier, the Punjab had seen the introduction of the Persian wheel, a mechanical device for raising water from open wells. Powered by draught animals and using wheels, gears, a crankshaft and buckets, the device could raise water from depths of ten to twenty metres, distributing it over the land through troughs and channels. The technology considerably expanded the production of the Punjab’s primary grain crop, wheat, which in turn sustained growing urban settlements in Delhi’s western and southern hinterlands.


Aided by the delta’s great distance from Delhi, however, the sultanate’s governors in Bengal repeatedly asserted their independence from their north Indian overlords.


Twice in the 1350s Delhi tried but failed to reconquer the delta. Then, for the next two centuries, Bengal was at last left undisturbed by north Indian armies. This long period of political independence contributed to the growth of a distinct Bengali regional identity.


strategy not unlike nineteenth-century India, where British imperialists divided conquered territory into directly administered provinces and indirectly ruled ‘princely states’. In the annexed regions of the northern Deccan, stretching from the Vindhya Mountains down to the Krishna River, Muhammad bin Tughluq imposed a colonial idea–that is, a tightly controlled direct rule, symbolized by the name-change of the Deccan’s provincial capital from Devagiri to Daulatabad, meaning ‘city of government’.


In the brief span of just eight years, between 1339 and 1347, the founders of these two dynasties had radically redrawn the plateau’s political map. Upon expelling Tughluq power from the Deccan, the Sangamas and the Bahmanis both established new, transregional states that sprawled across the plateau’s three vernacular zones: the Marathi, the Telugu and the Kannada.


Tibetan Buddhist prince, Rinchana, who reached the valley in 1320 after fleeing nearby Ladakh, where he had led a failed rebellion against his royal uncle. This was shortly after a Mongol chieftain, Zulju, had successfully invaded and devastated Kashmir–a notable exception to the string of failed attempts to penetrate the valley.


The sultan’s Hindu finance minister even suggested increasing the state’s coinage by melting down a brass image of the Buddha–a measure that Shihab al-Din, shocked at the proposal, refused.


Through it all, the actual management of the sultanate’s governance remained firmly in the hands of Brahmin ministers and administrators.


The most famous of these, the brilliant poet Amir Khusrau, was just as proud of his Indian heritage as he was skilled at turning a Persian verse.


Tughluqs’ revenue system rose in open rebellion against central authority and would soon emerge as independent sultanates. The first of these secessions occurred in Bengal, led by Shams al-Din Ilyas Shah in 1342. This was followed just five years later by the loss of the sultanate’s Deccan dependencies and the appearance of the independent Bahmani and Vijayanagara kingdoms. Fiscally, the sultanate’s loss of Bengal and the Deccan led to a silver famine that hindered its ability to purchase war-horses or pay its troops at the same levels as previously.


Kashmir, landlocked and secluded in its mountain fastness, had never been conquered by a Persianized state such as the Delhi sultanate.


Timur sought to unify this politically fragmented region by creating, in effect, a neo-Mongol empire. Although himself an ethnic Turk unrelated to Genghis Khan, he married a princess descended from the great Mongol empire-builder and on this basis proudly titled himself gurkan, or ‘imperial son-in-law’.


His failure to conquer China notwithstanding, in one important respect Timur accomplished what the Mongols themselves had repeatedly attempted but failed to do–namely, invade India and sack Delhi. In the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries the sultans of Delhi had prudently garrisoned soldiers in the mountain passes leading from Afghanistan to the Punjab, thereby thwarting Mongol attempts to invade India.


Although the Delhi sultanate survived Timur’s destructive onslaught, and even experienced something of a revival in the late 1400s, it would never regain the power or prestige it had enjoyed in the days of Muhammad bin Tughluq. In reality, Timur’s invasion inaugurated what has been called India’s ‘long fifteenth century’, that is, the period bracketed on the front end by Timur’s invasion in 1398–9, and on the back end by the advent of Mughal rule (1526–1858). The founder of the Mughal dynasty, Babur (r. 1526–30), was a direct descendant of Timur and claimed the right to govern north India as his legal patrimony. One might therefore think of the period 1398–1526 as a long interregnum between the planting of the idea of Timurid rule in India by Timur himself, and its eventual realization by Babur.


Much conventional historiography portrays the long fifteenth century as a dreary period when the stage lights in the theatre of history seem to have dimmed while onlookers are forced to sit in darkness, waiting for the curtain to rise to reveal the dazzling dawn of the Mughal era, when India would once again see a large, centralized empire. But in fact it was one of India’s most vibrant and creative eras. The fragmentation of northern India catalysed by Timur’s invasion meant, among other things, increasing demands for literary and military specialists, as throngs of competing chieftains and warlords sought to fill power vacuums created by the collapse of Delhi’s authority. Instead of a single, centralized locus of patronage, dozens of smaller such centres now mushroomed across north India’s landscape, each headed by an aspiring state-builder.


The founder of the Lodi dynasty, Bahlul Lodi (r. 1451–89), first reached India from Afghanistan with a long caravan of horses, for which the Saiyid government paid him with a land assignment instead of cash. That land soon became his political base. Later he was appointed governor of the Punjabi city of Sirhind.

Malwa thus presents a curious hybrid, inhabiting several worlds simultaneously. Important Sanskrit literature was produced during Mahmud Khalaji’s reign, including a copy of the Kalpa Sutra, a revered work on Jain rituals that maps a path for crossing life’s river of rebirths. Completed at Mandu in 1439, the Kalpa Sutra is also one of India’s earliest manuscripts bearing dated miniature paintings. 52 In fact, most of the styles of Rajasthan’s famous miniature tradition evolved from copies of this text that were produced either in Mandu or in the state’s hinterland. 53 This was probably due to the prominent role that powerful warrior chiefs linked to courts in Rajasthan played in Malwa’s political system. In 1463, while accompanying the sultan on a military campaign, Mahmud Khalaji’s chief treasurer, also a Jain, composed another important Sanskrit work, the Buddhi Sagar. 54 Because Jains were so prominent in managing the government’s accounting and revenue departments, and because the government relied so heavily on wealthy Jain merchants for financing its projects, the state actively supported its Jain community.


It was only from the sixteenth century that the word ‘Rajput’ became securely associated with territorially based, closed clans claiming deep genealogical roots and nurturing a warrior ethos of heroism and martyrdom.


In Persian sources dating to the early thirteenth century these commanders are called rawat, also derived from rajaputra.


fourteenth-century soldier known as Muhammad Shah in Persian sources and Mahimasahi in Sanskrit sources. 58 Revealing the fluidity of social categories and the ease with which men could move between them, an early-fifteenth-century Sanskrit text, the Hammira-Mahakavya, portrays Muhammad Shah/ Mahimasahi as transitioning from an ethnic Mongol, to an Indian Muslim, and finally to a kshatriya warrior.


Composed in the early fifteenth century, about a century after the events it describes, the Hammira-Mahakavya thus appears to capture a moment when the idea of Rajput was evolving.


By one mechanism or another, a process of ‘Rajputization’ occurred in new states that emerged from the turmoil following Timur’s invasion of 1398, especially in Gujarat, Malwa and Rajasthan.


For a poet such as Muhammad Jayasi (d. 1542), India was home, and his references to stepwells, temples, yogis, Jains, white-clad sadhus, Śiva-worshippers and so on all served to valorize that home. 71 The patrons of this literature, moreover, were Turkish or Afghan local rulers or regional warlords who had become transformed by the Indian culture that surrounded them. 72 Herein lies the contrast between a premakhyan like Jayasi’s Padmavat (1540) and courtly narratives of the early Delhi sultanate era. Whereas poets of that time had represented north India as a stage for enacting triumphal narratives of conquest, and indigenous warrior clans as infidels to be conquered and subdued, Jayasi reverses this opposition. In narrating ‘Ala al-Din Khalaji’s conquest of the fort of Chittor (1303), the poet identifies himself not with the victorious sultan but with the doomed Indians who resisted the invading Turks. For him, the Indians’ annihilation at Chittor becomes a metaphor for the Sufis’ ultimate mystical quest, namely annihilation of the self (fana’) by way of achieving an abiding presence of God. 73


In the Deccan (see Chapter Four), ruling authorities of the sultanates of Golconda (1497–1687) and Bijapur (1490–1686) realized that the most efficient way of managing their judicial and revenue bureaucracies was to employ the same class of skilled, literate administrators that had been serving the Deccan’s ruling authorities for centuries. In Golconda these were mostly Brahmins. Whereas that state’s royal edicts of the sixteenth century had been issued in Persian only, by the early seventeenth century such documents were typically issued in both Persian and Telugu. By the end of the seventeenth century, they were issued entirely in Telugu, with brief Persian summaries appearing only on their reverse sides.


the spread of paper-making technology, which Persianized Turks had introduced to north India from Central Asia in the thirteenth century; with the growth of the Delhi sultanate in the fourteenth century it diffused across South Asia. By the time that Timur sacked Delhi in 1398–9, it had already reached that sultanate’s provinces, so that in the fifteenth century, when they had become regional states, this revolutionary technology was already available for use.


Almost everywhere it went, paper-making technology gradually displaced other media such as copperplate, palm leaf or stone.


It is revealing that the ordinary words for ‘paper’ and ‘pen’ in many South Asian vernacular tongues are derived from two Perso-Arabic words, kaghaz and qalam respectively, suggesting not only the new technology’s path of transmission from Central Asia to South Asia, but also the deep impact that it had made on the peoples of India.


Privileging personal experience over ritual, bhakti celebrated mutual companionship among fellow devotees, including both sexes and all social strata. Moved by a direct engagement with divine reality, people turned to both poetry and song, the natural vehicles of bhakti, which invariably appeared in the spoken tongues of India’s various subregions, composed by poets popularly venerated as saints. 85 Writing in Hindavi, these included such powerful voices as Kabir (d. c. 1518), Raidas (d. c. 1520), Mirabai (d. 1557) and Surdas (d. 1573); in Bengali, Chaitanya (d. 1533); in Punjabi, Nanak (d. 1539); in Gujarati, Narsinh Mehta (d. 1488); and in Marathi, Namdev (d. 1350) and Eknath (d. 1599). 86


Upwardly mobile chieftains, aspiring to claw their way into the world of classical Indian kingship, sought the prestige associated with Sanskrit. 88 In Gujarat, Sanskrit texts were patronized both by the sultan and by chieftains challenging him. In the 1460s the Sanskrit poet Udayaraja produced a lengthy panegyric of Sultan Mahmud Begada, the Rajavinoda.


More Persian dictionaries were produced in India in the fifteenth century than in Iran, or for that matter in the entire world outside India.


During their installation ceremonies, the sultans of Bengal sent for water from Ganga Sagar, the ancient holy site where the old Ganges River emptied into the Bay of Bengal; they then washed themselves in that holy water in the manner of earlier Hindu sovereigns. 97 And in their public architecture, those sultans yielded so much to local conceptions of form and medium that, as one art historian observes, ‘the country, originally possessed by the invaders, now possessed them’. 98


Sultan Ahmad Bahmani


In 1430 Deva Raya II employed 10,000 Turkish troops in his armed forces, and in 1535 Rama Raya (d. 1565) recruited 3,000 Iranian and Turkish troops. 11 Tombs and mosques located in the urban core north-east of the Royal Centre indicate where they and their officers were settled. Krishna Raya (r. 1509–29) so valued his Muslim soldiers that in his 1520 invasion of Raichur he placed them in the vanguard of his troops.


In 1486 he was assassinated, and four years later Malik Ahmad, embittered by the politics of the court and the murder of his father, declared his independence at the fort of Junnar in Maharashtra, where he had been governor. He also established a new capital named after himself, Ahmadnagar, soon to become one of the Deccan’s most important centres of artistic patronage.


Warangal is South Asia’s best surviving example of a city replicating classical Indian conceptions of the world–that is, a great circular continent divided in four quarters and surrounded by a series of ring-shaped oceans, with the cosmic mountain Meru, where Śiva dwells, lying at its centre. At Warangal, the area within the inner, stone wall replicated the central continent, in the middle of which stood a great temple that was dedicated to Śiva and represented Mount Meru. Beyond the stone wall lay a moat representing a cosmic sea, with a second, outer wall and moat corresponding to the sea surrounding a second, ring-shaped continent and another sea. Standing at cardinal directions around the temple precincts, four majestic ceremonial gateways symbolized the sources of four rivers that flow outwards from Mount Meru, defining the universe’s four quarters.


As Hyderabad was established in 1591, corresponding to the year 1000 in the Islamic calendar, the city’s founding also inaugurated the second millennium of Islam. This would explain an important difference between these two structures: whereas Warangal’s chaubara is aligned with the cardinal directions, the Charminar is aligned with Mecca, which at Hyderabad’s latitude turns the structure ten degrees clockwise from cardinal directions. On the other hand, at the interior apex of the Charminar’s uppermost storey is a large solar lotus–the iconic Indian symbol of life and energy–with twelve smaller lotuses placed around it in the manner of the zodiac. In this way, the Charminar combined Indic and Persianate forms, while it was set in a city whose layout had been inspired by the memory of Telangana’s most famous regional dynasty, the Kakatiyas of Warangal. The monument may be understood, then, as one of India’s most eloquent visual representations of the interpenetration of the Indic and Persianate worlds.


Although Krishna Raya had named his other half-brother, Achyuta Raya, his successor, when the king died in 1529 Rama Raya tried to subvert his father-in-law’s choice by having the late king’s infant son proclaimed king and himself regent. Although the attempted power-grab was blocked by the kingdom’s nobility, Rama Raya exploited his position as minister and his marital connection with the late Krishna Raya by arranging that the command of key forts in the heartland–Adoni, Kurnool and Nandyal–be transferred to his Aravidu kinsmen. This marked an important step in Vijayanagara’s transition to a patrimonial state. Also,


It is widely assumed that such technologies and transformations first appeared in Europe and then diffused to the rest of the world in the early period of European colonialism, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However, the presence of gun-ports built into the walls of forts at Bidar, Kalyana and Raichur indicate that as early as the 1460s cannon were being used defensively in the heart of the plateau. In the early 1470s the Bahmani minister Mahmud Gawan directed military operations in which he seems to have referred to the use of siege cannon.


Afonso de Albuquerque (d. 1515), the viceroy and mastermind of the Portuguese enterprise in the Indian Ocean region, was so impressed with the weaponry manufactured at Goa that he reported to the king of Portugal in 1513 that Muslim gunsmiths there were making firearms of higher quality than those produced in Germany, which the Portuguese had considered the finest anywhere.


Two points stand out regarding the Battle of Raichur. First, the side that possessed what might seem the superior military technology–the 200 cannon defending the fort, and the 400 field cannon at the pitched battle–lost to an army using pickaxes and crowbars at the fort, and mounted archers at the pitched battle. Given the apparent advantages of gunpowder technology, such an outcome might seem counter-intuitive. But in both venues, Bijapur’s forces lost because of their faulty use of firearms. At the fort their cannon, placed on immobile carriages and fixed in their gun-ports, were unable to be easily manoeuvred in any direction, severely reducing their effectiveness. And at the Krishna, instead of firing their cannon in an orderly sequence of staggered volleys, Isma‘il’s artillerymen launched them all at once, enabling Krishna Raya’s remaining ranks of cavalry to attack the Bijapuris from the rear. Second, the two armies drew exactly opposite conclusions from the battle’s outcome. Krishna Raya, though impressed with the matchlocks used by his Portuguese mercenaries, failed to see firearms as the way of the future. Both in the pitched battle by the river and at the besieged fort he had prevailed against Bijapur’s artillery without making significant use of firearms, which seems to have reinforced the king’s confidence in the efficacy of the conventional technologies and tactics of the day. There is no evidence that he followed up his victories by establishing an arsenal or a matchlock foundry in Vijayanagara. Nor did he or his successors ever mount cannon on the walls of their capital or provincial forts, or in other ways adapt their defensive systems to accommodate gunpowder technology. To the contrary, his victories at Raichur and other sites throughout southern India had the effect of lulling Krishna Raya and his commanders into a state of complacency, with the result that Vijayanagara’s military system stagnated. Apart from hiring some foreign mercenaries adept at using handguns, for the rest of its existence the state of Vijayanagara failed to take gunpowder technology very seriously.


Bijapur, by contrast, responded quite differently to the battle’s outcome, suggesting that the assimilation of new technologies can be a slow, painful process of trial and error, in the course of which failures can be as important as successes. Leaders in Bijapur understood from their twin failures at Raichur that, despite the advances in cannon technology they had made at their Goa arsenal, they needed to learn much more about the development and deployment of firearms, both defensively and offensively. They therefore launched an accelerated drive to pioneer new gunpowder technologies.


Sultan ‘Ali ‘Adil Shah I


In a scene indicating the supreme necessity of preserving their relative status, the three men conversed for about half an hour without ever dismounting from their elephants. Given the ties between elephants and royal authority in Indian culture, 58 none of them could have stepped to the ground without appearing to have relinquished his kingly status.


Portuguese mariners–into the Indian Ocean in search of commodities even more valuable than beaver pelts: spices, and especially Malabar pepper, highly prized as a food seasoning. For at least 1,500 years Malabar had been the world’s principal source of this ‘black gold’, as the Dutch called the spice, drawing to its shores long-distance merchants from as far away as the Mediterranean basin and the South China Sea.


Already in the first century AD Romans worried about the drain of hard currency going to feed their countrymen’s seemingly insatiable demand for Indian luxuries, especially pepper. By the thirteenth century China had become the world’s largest consumer of black pepper, with Hangzhou alone consuming more than 4,300 kilograms a day, if Marco Polo is to be believed.


In 1502 Vasco da Gama, returning to Calicut with twenty ships and nearly 1,000 men, sank a merchant ship sailing from Mecca, drowning 700 pilgrims, and then demanded that the Zamorin expel all Muslim merchants from the city. When the Zamorin refused to comply, da Gama also bombarded the city and then sailed down to Cochin, where he stationed a flotilla of ships at the post established by Cabral. This violent and monopolistic approach to trade quickly internationalized warfare on the Indian Ocean. In 1508, warships of Mamluk Egypt joined those of the sultanate of Gujarat to defeat a Portuguese fleet near Chaul (forty kilometres south of Mumbai), and nine years later an Ottoman fleet prevented the Portuguese from conquering the Red Sea port of Jiddah.


Throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, twice as much Vijayanagara coinage circulated in the Bahmani state as did the Bahmanis’ own coins. In fact, more Vijayanagara coins circulated in the Bahmani kingdom than in Vijayanagara itself.


Vijayanagara’s hons still circulated in the northern Deccan. In fact, they were in such demand that from 1513 onwards the northern sultanates, succumbing to reality, began assessing agricultural and commercial taxes in the hon, and not exclusively in their own dinars or tankas. Even after 1565, when the Vijayanagara state was severely crippled following the Battle of Talikota, Bijapur, Golconda and Ahmadnagar not only continued using the Vijayanagara coins in their official transactions, but from the 1580s they began minting their own hons, thereafter the only type of coin mentioned in sultanate inscriptions. These coins bore the same standard of weight and purity as the old Vijayanagara-minted coins, the only difference being that the Sanskrit titles and images of Hindu deities of the old coins were replaced by Persian lettering. But even this compromise was not accepted by the peoples living within the sultanates’ frontiers. As the older, ‘genuine’ Vijayanagara hons became rarer with the passage of time, their intrinsic value increased relative to that of the sultanate’s newer hons. In their normal transactions, people therefore preferred using the hons that had earlier been minted in Vijayanagara. Nonetheless, the sultanates tried to enforce the use of their own, newer hons. In 1654 ‘Adil Shahi authorities in Bijapur ordered the confiscation of the property of anybody who used the older hons minted by the defunct Vijayanagara state instead of Bijapur’s hons. But such royal edicts evidently failed. Within several decades of that order, even the Muslim functionaries of a Qutb Shahi mosque were insisting that an annual grant made for their maintenance be made not in Golconda’s minted hons, but in ‘genuine’ hons–that is, the currency minted by Vijayanagara over a century earlier, bearing Sanskrit lettering and images of Hindu deities. 75


Krishna Raya also appears wearing tall, conical headgear called kullayi in Telugu (kulah in Persian). This item of apparel had migrated to India from Iran, where it was associated with high social status, even royalty. With whom, then, is Krishna Raya to be identified–a Hindu deity, a Persian nobleman, or both? The ambiguity conveyed in this


the word ‘Mughal’ is simply Persian for ‘Mongol’.


Babur was just eleven years old in 1494 when, on his father’s death, he ascended the throne of Ferghana, a small Central Asian principality 350 kilometres east of Samarqand, the jewel of Timurid Central Asia.


Babur’s female relatives, including his sister Khanzada, his


It is due to his long record of suffering at the hands of his Uzbek and other enemies that Babur’s memoirs are pervaded by themes of defeat, humiliation, displacement and exile.


In 1514, abandoning the possibility of ever regaining Samarqand, Babur returned to his base in Kabul and again began to look to the north Indian plain, this time not as an object of plunder, but as territory for building a sovereign domain large and stable enough to preserve the threatened Timurid house from extinction. This was his foremost objective.


In late 1525 Babur, aged forty-two, launched his fifth and final invasion of India, marching from Kabul at the head of an army of 8,000 men,


By midday, the decisive Battle of Panipat had left Sultan Ibrahim dead on the battlefield, with no obstacle standing between Babur and Delhi. Far from plundering that city as his Timurid ancestor had done, however, Babur took care to secure its palaces, guarantee the safety of its population, arrange for a pension for the mother of the slain Lodi sultan, and pay his respects to the shrines of the city’s most prominent Sufi saints–the Chishti shaikhs Qutb al-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki (d. 1236) and Nizam al-Din Auliya. Such measures signalled that the Mughals not only would remain in north India, but that they would patronize the same ‘invisible sovereigns’ as had several centuries of Delhi’s rulers, thereby establishing a spiritual continuity between themselves and previous Delhi-based dynasties. There was no going back to Samarqand. India would be Babur’s home and the seat of his kingdom, which he was determined to pass on to his descendants.


On achieving victory over Rana Sanga, he referred to his army as an ‘army of Islam’ and himself as a ghazi, or ‘holy warrior’, a title he now added to his seal. 6 Immediately after the contest, though, the title disappeared from his vocabulary.


although he held neither India nor Indians in very high regard, he was pragmatic, being well aware of his precarious position as an outsider in a large and politically volatile land. He was therefore quick to reach agreements with the Sisodiya lineage after defeating Rana Sanga at Khanua, as he did with other Rajput leaders in Awadh, Malwa and the Punjab.


Although he reigned in India for just under four years, Babur left a solid foundation for his descendants to build on: a ruling structure dominated by Mongols and Turks, a court guided by a Timurid ruling ideology, the spiritual direction of Naqshbandi shaikhs, and durable ties between India and the Persianate world. He left no grand monuments, apart from mosques at Panipat, Sambhal and Ayodhya, but he did bequeath to his successors a refined aesthetic sensibility and a fascination with the natural world, as is graphically reflected in his memoirs.


Many of these soldiers regrouped around one of the most brilliant warriors of the age, the Afghan chieftain Sher Khan Sur. In point of military talent, he and Humayun differed profoundly. Whereas the former was strategically gifted and bold, the latter was inept and excessively cautious. Whereas the Afghan chieftain was self-disciplined, Humayun indulged in protracted bouts with wine or drugs. Sher Khan’s career also suggests how Afghans had become rooted in the north Indian countryside since the mid fifteenth century. Born as Farid Khan in 1486 in present-day Haryana, he was known in his youth as Sher Khan owing to his reputation for courage, for shir is Persian for lion (or tiger). But because he belonged to the Sur clan, a marginal Afghan lineage unrelated to the politically dominant Lodis, he lacked ready access to upper India’s rich agrarian resources. At some point between 1501 and 1511 he became a freelance soldier in the Jaunpur region. But it was further down the Gangetic plain, in western Bihar, that he built up a political base.


The Mughals having vacated the entire Indo-Gangetic plain, Sher Shah now set himself up in Delhi as Hindustan’s sole sovereign and founder of a new ruling house, the Sur dynasty (1540–56). For five years, until his untimely death in 1545, he governed a realm renowned for its stability, prosperity and orderly government.


To ensure a predictable flow of revenue to the royal centre, he systemized the measurement of agricultural lands, something that had been introduced only sporadically by previous rulers of the Delhi sultanate, notably ‘Ala al-Din Khalaji. He also stabilized his regime’s economy by establishing a trimetallic currency based on the silver rupiya, which he issued at a standard weight of 178 grains, complemented by the gold mohur and the copper dam. This standardized silver coin anticipated the modern rupee, found in states of South and South-east Asia today. Well aware of India’s strategic need for commerce with Central Asia, especially for importing war-horses, he renovated and extended one of the most famous roads in Asia–the Grand Trunk Road linking Sonargaon in eastern Bengal with Peshawar in western Punjab, with further extensions to Kabul. Because so many of his governing traditions have survived into modern times, the Republic of India issued a postage stamp in his honour in 1970, as did Pakistan in 1991. Sher Shah’s most visible legacy lies in his architectural projects. In Delhi, he made considerable alterations and additions to the Purana Qila, the palace–citadel complex that Humayun had begun building in 1533. There he patronized the construction of an elaborately decorated mosque, whose façade of articulated entrance archway and alternating red sandstone and white marble recalls the entranceway of the Alai Darwaza in Delhi’s Qutb Minar complex, suggesting Sher Shah’s intention to link himself visually to Sultan ‘Ala al-Din Khalji, the mightiest of Delhi’s sultans. He also built a pair of imposing forts: Rohtas in western Punjab near the city of Jhelum, and Rohtasgarh in the Son valley, south-western Bihar. Finally, in Sasaram, his original political base 115 kilometres east of Benares, he built for himself a large three-storeyed domed octagonal mausoleum. Standing in the middle of an artificial lake, this massive structure rises to forty-six metres, surpassing in size the tomb of any previous Indian ruler. Nearby, his son and successor, Islam Shah Sur (r. 1545–54), began an even larger octagonal tomb for himself, but it was never completed. The scale of these tombs probably motivated subsequent Mughal rulers to build ever more monumental tomb complexes for themselves–most spectacularly, the Taj Mahal–by outperforming their former Afghan adversaries. 13


The sudden collapse of the Sur house appears to have energized Humayun and concentrated his focus in ways seldom seen earlier in his career. In July 1555 he and his troops triumphantly entered Delhi. Restored at last to his throne, Humayun acted vigorously to reestablish his authority after a fifteen-year absence. He also redefined the nature of Mughal kingship in ways that departed from his father’s ‘first-among-equals’ style of governance. Acting within the Timurid tradition, Babur had given his sons separate, semi-independent regions to govern. But Humayun’s long and painful experience with his brothers set a precedent for how subsequent Mughals, having attained the throne, would deal with their own brothers. Notwithstanding his mild temperament and his father’s admonitions to show kindness to his brothers, Humayun’s actions marked a crucial step in making succession to the Mughal throne a bloody fraternal struggle.


Central to Humayun’s courtly style was his identification with the sun, which was coloured gold on his courtly carpet and placed in the middle of the planetary spheres. He also greeted the rising sun every morning, showing his face to the public just as the sun showed itself to the king.


many of the ideological and institutional foundations of Mughal rule commonly associated with the reign of Akbar (r. 1556–1605) were already in place during Humayun’s turbulent reign, or during the interregnum of Sher Shah and his successors. Tragically, however, notwithstanding the many travails suffered in regaining his kingdom, Humayun lived for only six months after restoring Mughal rule. In late January 1556, he accidently fell from the staircase of his library in the Purana Qila and died shortly thereafter.


No succession struggle followed Humayun’s death. At the time, Akbar was thirteen and already in the capital of Delhi, whereas his half-brother Mirza Hakim was a two-year old child and in distant Kabul. It was apparent, moreover, that Akbar was blessed with a gift for memory and remarkable intelligence, even though his tutors were unable to teach him to read or write, as he was apparently dyslexic.


Thanks to Bairam Khan’s exertions so early in Akbar’s reign, Hemu’s uprising had been quashed, and the heartland of upper India had fallen securely under Mughal control. The last two prominent princes of Sher Shah’s dynasty, Sikandar and Ibrahim, were soon defeated and driven away, while the stronghold of Gwalior, 100 kilometres south of Agra, was secured after a two-year siege.


the same time, he restored relations with the household of Bairam Khan, whom he had manoeuvred out of India altogether, by marrying one of the latter’s widows. He also adopted into his household one of Bairam Khan’s sons, a four-year-old child who would ultimately emerge as one of the most powerful nobles in Akbar’s court: Khan-i Khanan.


Alone among the Rajput clans, the Sisodiyas of Mewar in southern Rajasthan, north India’s pre-eminent warrior lineage, obstinately refused to negotiate with the Mughals. In response, Akbar in 1568 led a four-month siege of the Sisodiyas’ principal stronghold of Chittor, which ultimately fell to the Mughals, but only after a spectacular jauhar in which the fort’s defenders, foreseeing their doom, killed their women and gallantly sallied forth to meet their deaths. In all, some 30,000 defenders of the fort were killed, although its ruler, Rana Pratap, managed to escape. For decades, he and the Sisodiya house would continue to resist Mughal domination, whereas nearly every other Rajput lineage had acknowledged Mughal overlordship.


Akbar’s inclusion of Rajput warriors in the Mughal army also served a political purpose. Just as Rajput chiefs such as Bharmal saw Mughal allies as a counterweight to the influence of their own kinsmen, Akbar regarded his Rajput allies as counterweights to Uzbek Turks, a potentially unruly faction in his service that he had inherited from his father. Moreover, from the Mughal perspective, the alliance had pacified Rajasthan after centuries of turbulence, rendering it no longer a breeding ground for revolt, as it had been under the Delhi sultans.


Because Akbar saw the incorporation of women of prominent royal houses into the Mughal household as a tool of empire-building, the size of his harem grew with that of the empire–contemporary estimates of the number of his wives range from 300 to 5,000.18 This had the effect of swelling the Mughal court into a huge, multi-ethnic and women-centred world, with the Rajput element in the imperial harem steadily gaining in influence relative to that of other ethnicities.


Although few written accounts of the Rajput past survive from the period before Akbar’s reign, from the mid sixteenth century on, just when Akbar was engaging intensely with Rajasthan’s warrior lineages,


In 1572 he occupied the regional capital of Ahmedabad, legally annexed the province and returned to his new capital, which he renamed Fatehpur Sikri in commemoration of his victorious Gujarat campaign (Fatehpur means ‘city of victory’).


Though unreliable and unpredictable, the emperor’s half-brother had at least provided a buffer between the Uzbeks and the Mughal heartland. But with him gone, Akbar needed to keep a closer watch on the turbulent north-west and the ever-dangerous Uzbeks–once his grandfather’s nemesis, and now his own. So in 1586 he moved his capital for a third time, abandoning Fatehpur Sikri for the historic city of Lahore. Meanwhile,


Akbar’s success lay not so much in his superior use of military force as in how his officers co-opted political agents, intervened and mediated in local conflicts, and generated credit among conquered populations.


Ibn al-‘ Arabi,


For administering justice, provincial judges appointed district-level judges (qazi, shiqdar), who judged civil and criminal cases on the basis of the Islamic shari‘a. Cases involving non-Muslims were normally decided by village councils (panchayat) according to local custom, although Mughal judges also adjudicated such cases on the basis of local custom, not Islamic law. 72 All this testifies to the care Akbar gave to upholding the principle of justice, an ideal inherited from centuries of Persianate discourse and practice. 73 Capital cases and important civil cases were normally conducted by the emperor himself, who alone could issue a death penalty.


Between Babur’s arrival in Delhi in 1526 and Akbar’s death in 1605, the Mughal dynasty had become rooted in the heart of north India.


Babur’s brief reign, his son Humayun was driven from India before he could consolidate his rule. Ironically, it was another Indo-Afghan, the capable Sher Shah Sur (r. 1540–45), who established many of the administrative traditions that Humayun and his son Akbar would then inherit and elaborate. In his long, nearly half-century reign, Akbar put in place the empire’s most enduring ruling institutions, while the dynasty’s character completed its transition from a mobile ruling group steeped in semi-pastoral Central Asian traditions to a sedentary empire based on the economic, political and cultural traditions of agrarian India.

Babur’s memoir, the Babur-nama, with Abu’l-fazl’s history of Akbar’s reign, the Akbar-nama. Although Babur had dwelt at length on India’s flora and fauna, he showed very little interest in the cultures of India, dismissing its peoples as ‘infidels’. By contrast, Abu’l-fazl characterizes Indians as ‘seekers of God, kindhearted, friendly to strangers, congenial, and pleasant. They are fond of knowledge, inclined toward austerities, committed to justice, content, hardworking, skilled, loyal, honest and trustworthy.’ 78 In short, the Akbar-nama affirms the empire’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious character, promoting Akbar as a committed guardian of India’s cultural diversity.


Portuguese Estado da India established its first coastal toehold in 1500.


Of his three sons, Akbar favoured his firstborn, Salim, to succeed him. Yet Salim, even while being groomed for the throne, felt excluded from what he deemed his proper share of royal authority. He was especially jealous of the attention that his father showered on his principal adviser and friend, Abu’l-fazl.


Their marriage several months later created one of the most extraordinary marital partnerships in Mughal history. Nur Jahan, as the emperor would title her, was already a mature woman of thirty-four and the mother of a young girl from an earlier marriage. She was also the daughter of a high-ranking Iranian immigrant, I‘timad al-Daula, who had served Akbar and was now in Jahangir’s court, together with his son Asaf Khan.


she was an excellent shot. In a single day in 1617 she killed four tigers from atop an elephant, firing only six bullets without a single miss.


Jahangir also inherited the perennial north Indian ambition, going back to the days of Ashoka (r. 268–232 BC), of conquering the Deccan plateau, thereby bringing territories both north and south of the Vindhya Mountains under the sway of a single, northern sovereign. Both ‘Ala al-Din Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughluq had been seized by this ambition. In Mughal times Akbar was the first to chip away at the Deccan’s north-western corner, conquering and occupying Asirgarh and Burhanpur in Khandesh, and the Nizam Shahi capital of Ahmadnagar (though not its territory).


wife to accepting his stepmother’s offer. The queen then focused on marrying Ladli to Jahangir’s youngest surviving son, the sixteen-year-old Shahryar. Although the lad was widely dismissed as an inexperienced lightweight, in late 1620 his marriage took place, and immediately the queen’s clique began to crumble. Her father I‘timad al-Daula, for years the pillar of the clique, died soon after the marriage ceremonies had concluded, while her brother Asaf Khan stoutly supported Khurram, to whom his own daughter Arjomand Banu was married. With brother and sister now backing different princes, and Nur Jahan’s new son-in-law by far the weaker of the two, the queen became ever more isolated, even as her influence over her failing husband continued to grow.


in mid 1624 Khurram was again defeated by Mahabat Khan near Allahabad. Once more he returned to the Deccan where, having run out of options, he begged for the court’s full pardon. In early 1626 Nur Jahan replied that he would first have to surrender several forts–Rohtas in Bihar and Asirgarh in Khandesh–and as a sign of good faith, send to the court two of his sons: ten-year-old Dara Shukoh and eight-year-old Aurangzeb. Khurram complied, and in June 1626 the two boys reached Lahore, where they were placed under the queen’s care.


Whereas a prince might acquire the skills of political networking in a gradual way while serving as a governor or field commander, in the midst of rebellion he had to learn them very quickly to survive. Prince Khusrau had failed that test. In a rebellion lasting less than a month in early 1606, he had only begun frantically forging alliances before he was captured, blinded and imprisoned. Prince Khurram, by contrast, had passed the test, but not without enduring great hardships. In November 1623, by the time he reached the Andhra coast with the imperial army in hot pursuit, he had been reduced to just 4,500 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and 500 elephants. 5 But because he managed to stay just beyond the reach of the imperial forces, he had three full years to build up broad political networks across a wide expanse stretching from Gujarat to Bengal, and from Allahabad to the northern Deccan. Everywhere he went, he gained the support of groups either previously opposed to the Mughals or poorly integrated into imperial


Another lesson to draw from Khurram’s three-year rebellion is the court’s benign response to it. Once he fulfilled the conditions imposed on him for a pardon, he was fully rehabilitated into the imperial structure. His reconciliation with Jahangir recalls Jahangir’s own with Akbar after he, as Prince Salim, had similarly rebelled against imperial authority. For such reasons Mughal succession struggles, while disastrous for their losers and disruptive for many in the short term, could in the long run be restorative for the empire as a whole. New elites and political networks were invariably swept into power with their victors, thereby replenishing the entire system. 8


although Jahangir’s paternal grandfather was Humayun, his maternal grandfather was Raja Bharmal, leader of the Kachwaha Rajput lineage. Jahangir’s mother, Harkha, 29 entitled Mariam al-Zamani, was the sister of Raja Bharmal’s son and successor, Bhagwant Das. Jahangir himself, then, was biologically half Rajput. He, in turn, married the daughters of prominent Rajput rulers who had submitted to Mughal overlordship. Seven of his seventeen wives before Nur Jahan had come from Rajput lineages: two from Amber, and one each from Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Jhabua, Bikaner and Orchha. 30 His son Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, was born of one of these Rajputs–Jagat Gosain Begum, the daughter of Udai Singh of Jodhpur. Shah Jahan was therefore three-quarters Rajput by blood.


Because their ties with Africa had been permanently severed, these men necessarily adopted the Deccan as their home, readily embracing the local culture and becoming fiercely loyal to the region and its political systems.


The rights to lands inherited by Shivaji (r. 1674–80), who would found the Maratha kingdom later in the seventeenth century, were initially conferred on his father, Shahji, by the sultans of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur in return for his service to those states. It was the sanad from the court that gave a deshmukh authority over his own kinsmen and the state’s backing if they opposed him, as they often did. As a result, the history of Maharashtra and the Maratha polity is essentially the history of these deshmukh families.


sultanates that had initially recruited them. In short, the rise of Maratha power–such an important socio-political development between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries–was deeply rooted in the Marathas’ prior patronage by the region’s sultanates.


Guru Amar Das built a well of eighty-four steps in his village of Goindwal, which became the Sikhs’ first pilgrimage centre. Before his death in 1574, he had begun excavating a great tank on a plot of 500 bighas (a unit of land area) given to him by Akbar. Completed by the next guru, Ram Das (1574–81), the tank would become known as Amritsar, ‘the nectar of immortality’. Eventually the town that grew up around the tank would be known by that name, too, as it became the primary seat of Sikh authority.


Khusrau happened to halt at the place where he [Guru Arjun] was, and he came out and did homage to him. He behaved to Khusrau in certain special ways, and made on his forehead a fingermark in saffron, which the Indians (Hinduwan) call qashqa [tika], and is considered auspicious. When this came to my ears and I clearly understood his folly, I ordered them to produce him [Arjun] … and having confiscated his property commanded that he should be put to death. 51 Jahangir ordered the execution not out of any animus against Sikhism, which in any event he failed to recognize as a separate religion, but because of the guru’s apparent support for a state rebel.


Nur Jahan was deeply devoted to the emperor, as he was to her.


Like Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq before him, Jahangir made ostentatious displays of his devotion to justice.


The contrasting temperaments of father and son could hardly be more stark. And yet he shared with Akbar a fascination with Indian religions, he maintained his father’s practice of sponsoring inter-faith debates, and he went out of his way to visit the Hindu ascetic Jadrup, in whose cave near Ujjain he thrice held extended philosophical discussions. Those meetings, too, he ordered to be documented in art [see Fig. 16].


Shah Jahan. On 4 February 1628, at an hour precisely fixed by his astrologers, he was formally crowned emperor.


In this respect Shah Jahan broke from the tradition of his Timurid ancestors, most of whom had personally engaged in battlefield combat.


Shah Jahan–alone among Mughal emperors–tried to reclaim for the Mughal empire territory that both Timur and Babur had once ruled. So in the mid 1640s he sent armies across Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush Mountains into Central Asia, there to confront his dynasty’s ancient enemies, the Uzbeks.

Aurangzeb. It has been suggested that for sixty years, from the mid seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, the history of India and that of this one individual are practically the same.


This was Shahji Bhonsle (1594–1664), whose father had been the right-hand man of Malik Ambar, the Ethiopian ex-slave who for two decades had fended off Jahangir’s repeated attempts to annex the Nizam Shahi kingdom of Ahmadnagar.


Dara Shikoh


From Burhanpur, Aurangzeb moved down to Kirki, the new Mughal provincial capital which the prince renamed Aurangabad, after himself.


The prime minister of that kingdom was another Iranian immigrant, Mir Jumla (d. 1663), who had amassed such immense wealth as a gem-merchant that he raised and commanded his own armies, which roused the intense jealousy of his master, the sultan. Upon learning that the sultan sought to ruin him, Mir Jumla made overtures to Aurangzeb about defecting to Mughal service, which the prince warmly welcomed even though the 1636 treaty had banned such intrigues.


When the sultan imprisoned Mir Jumla’s son on account of improper behaviour in court, Shah Jahan sanctioned Aurangzeb’s request to invade if that son were not released. But by the time the sultan set Mir Jumla’s son free, Aurangzeb had already sent a Mughal army to invade and plunder Hyderabad, near Golconda fort. The prince now begged his father for permission to annex the southern quarter of the kingdom (extending south to the Palar River), on the grounds that that enormous area had formerly been the jagir of Mir Jumla, who had recently defected to Mughal service. He also played upon his father’s well-known weakness for jewels, portraying Golconda as a land awash with diamonds and buried treasures, ripe for the picking. In this effort he was helped by Mir Jumla, who presented Shah Jahan with the world’s largest diamond, the celebrated Koh-i-Noor. 19 At the same time, Golconda’s agents in Delhi, knowing that Dara would do anything to deny his brother the glory of annexing Golconda’s territory, lobbied Shah Jahan, through Dara, against annexation. But the emperor’s greed, as Aurangzeb correctly calculated, trumped any scruples he might have had. So he approved the annexation.


1656 the prince’s opportunity arrived with the news of Muhammad ‘Adil Shah’s death, followed by rumours that his eighteen-year-old son was not of legitimate parentage and was therefore barred from lawfully succeeding as sultan. Welcoming such rumours as a gift from heaven, Aurangzeb immediately requested permission to invade and annex the whole of Bijapur on the grounds that it had no legitimate sovereign. Upon receiving his father’s sanction, he besieged the former Bahmani capital of Bidar, then under Bijapur’s rule, and when it fell in March 1657 he moved on to Kalyana, the other formidable stronghold defending Bijapur’s northern frontier. That fort surrendered in August. Seeing that nothing was likely to stop him from besieging and possibly capturing Bijapur’s capital itself, Dara Shukoh, driven by a seething jealousy over his younger brother’s successes, managed to persuade his father to call off the invasion. Bitterly aware that this was all Dara’s doing, Aurangzeb had no choice but to pull back. The stage was set for a decisive moment in Mughal history.


And they well understood that only one of them would survive the struggle to succeed him: according to the well-known Persian proverb, it was ‘either the throne, or the coffin’ (ya takht, ya takhta). The news of the emperor’s illness therefore sparked a four-way struggle among Shah Jahan’s four sons, India’s bloodiest and most notorious war of succession.


Aurangzeb issued dozens of documents between 1659 and 1703 supporting a variety of religious individuals and institutions: Jain saints, sadhus and monasteries (maths), temple Brahmins, gosains (wandering ascetics), Jangams (Śaiva priests), Hindu preceptors and yogis. 20 Both brothers had thoroughly imbibed the culture of institutional Sufism. Dara authored three treatises and two biographical dictionaries on the subject, while Aurangzeb throughout his life patronized Sufi shrines and revered holy men. 21 The bitter antagonism between the brothers took a religious turn only once the War of Succession had begun.


In 1656–7 he assembled a group of learned Brahmins of Benares and translated essential parts of the Upanishads into Persian. He also seized upon a Qur’anic passage stating that the Qur’an itself is ‘in a hidden Book [that] none but the purified shall touch, a sending down from the Lord of all Being’. 30 Placing this passage side by side with his monotheistic reading of the Upanishads, Dara convinced himself that the ‘hidden Book’ mentioned in the Qur’an was in fact the Upanishads. 31


Dara’s researches and striking conclusions had unexpected consequences. A copy of his Persian translation of the Upanishads was later acquired by the French Orientalist A. H. Anquetil-Duperron (d. 1805), who in turn translated it into Latin, a copy of which found its way to the library and even the bedside of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (d. 1860). By such circuitous pathways, interest in ancient Indian philosophy quickened in nineteenth-century Europe. 32 In India, however, Dara’s ideas that a full understanding of Islam depended upon the study of the Upanishads, and that those scriptures anticipated Islamic monotheism, were seen by many as theologically deviant. Foremost among these was his younger brother and most dangerous rival. On the conclusion of the War of Succession, and only a year after the Sirr-i akbar was completed, Aurangzeb invoked Dara’s naming the Vedas a divine book as one of the grounds for his execution. 33


Leading up to the succession struggle, however, Dara’s greatest difficulties were political, as his arrogance and immature behaviour alienated the very nobles whose support he would have needed in his final confrontations with Aurangzeb. He told the Mughals’ powerful Rajput ally Jai Singh (d. 1667), the Kachhwaha raja of Amber, that he looked like a musician, a serious insult.


Most seriously, perhaps, Dara on one occasion committed the unforgivable affront of beating Khalil Allah Khan (d. 1662) with his shoe. At a crucial point in the pivotal Battle of Samugarh (1658), the Uzbek commander would take his revenge by advising Dara, for his ‘personal safety’, to dismount from his elephant and mount a horse. As Khalil Allah expected, Dara’s men could no longer see their leader and so, assuming he had been killed, panicked and fled the battlefield. 35


Aurangzeb’s extensive military experience, his known abilities as a commander, his superior skills in political networking and his cool, calculating character. Manucci described Aurangzeb as totally different from his brothers, ‘very secretive and serious, carrying on his affairs in a hidden way, but most energetically. He was of a melancholy temperament, always busy at something or another.’ 36 And François Bernier: ‘Aureng-Zebe … was devoid of that urbanity and engaging presence, so much admired in Dara; but he possessed a sounder judgment, and was more skillful in selecting for confidants such persons as were best qualified to serve him with faithfulness and ability.’ The Frenchman added that ‘his life had been one of undeviating intrigue and contrivance; conducted, however, with such admirable skill, that every person in the court, excepting only his brother, Dara, seemed to form an erroneous estimate of his character.’ 37


Aurangzeb had actually saddled up and was riding towards the Agra fort to meet his father when he was handed an intercepted message from Shah Jahan to Dara, in which the emperor advised his eldest son to collect an army in Delhi and stay there while he concluded his negotiations with Aurangzeb. Such evidence of his father’s continued collusion with Dara convinced Aurangzeb that he was walking into a trap. So he aborted the intended interview and instead ordered his men to take possession of all royal effects, treasures and so on, and to keep the emperor confined in the palace. 40 Until his death seven years later, Shah Jahan would never again leave the fort.


His success in consolidating his authority is seen in the response to his own serious illness just three years into his reign. Although physicians despaired of his recovery, no prince or noble made any move to restore the still-confined Shah Jahan to power, far less wage another succession war on his own behalf.


Shivaji Bhonsle (1630–80), repeatedly used courage and savvy to outmanoeuvre his adversaries. His ancestral roots, like those of most deshmukh families, were embedded in the Deccan’s sultanate systems. Shivaji’s grandfather, Maloji, had been in the service of Malik Ambar, the powerful Habshi ex-slave and vazir of the Nizam Shahi sultanate who held off Jahangir’s repeated invasions of the Deccan between 1605 and 1626. Malik Ambar had given land in the western Deccan’s Sholapur and Pune region to Maloji’s son Shahji, who first tried to prop up the collapsing Nizam Shahi sultanate after Malik Ambar’s death, and then briefly entered Shah Jahan’s service as a mansabdar, before finally defecting to Bijapur in 1636.


Tarabai’s energetic leadership not only rescued the Maratha state from disintegration. In her northern invasions she sought to extend that state well beyond the Marathi-speaking Deccan. By striking deep into the Mughal heartland, she anticipated policies her Maratha successors would adopt later in the eighteenth century.


In 1695 the Mughal camp at Galgali, by the Krishna, measured about fifty kilometres in circumference and contained 60,000 cavalry, 100,000 infantry, 50,000 camels, 3,000 elephants, 250 bazaars and another several hundred thousand servants, merchants and hangers-


The Mughal effort was plagued by other, internal problems. As ‘Alamgir approached his ninetieth year of age and his fiftieth year as emperor, many of his veteran generals were dying, leaving him with flattering upstarts much too intimidated by the stubborn octogenarian to dare suggest a change of policy. Petty quarrels and jealousies within his corps of commanders further reduced the Mughals’ effectiveness. In this dismal situation ‘Alamgir did what came naturally to him: instead of leaving field command to his generals, from 1699 to 1705 he personally oversaw many siege operations. Like the Fool in Shakespeare’s King Lear, who witnessed his aged lord rage on a barren heath and descend into madness, ‘Alamgir’s advisers seem to have understood the futility of it all. Bhimsen wrote, ‘Emperor Alamgir who is not in want of anything, has been seized with such a longing and passion for taking forts that he personally runs about panting for some heaps of stone [hill forts].’ 68


As Mark Twain reputedly said: ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.’


In contrast to his elder brother, whom he publicly portrayed as a deviant backslider whose execution was justified partly on religious grounds, Aurangzeb projected himself as a correct Muslim. With Shah Jahan he ratcheted up this posture still higher. In bitter written exchanges with his father, confined to his palace in Agra, the new emperor self-righteously posed as the champion of Islam, stressing that Dara had usurped power and promoted Hinduism during their father’s illness. He even claimed that his own victories at Dharmat and Samugarh demonstrated divine sanction for his enterprise. 83 Accordingly, soon after his coronation he ceased participating in courtly functions that conflicted with his understanding of Islam, such as celebrating the Persian New Year’s Day (Nauruz), patronizing music and art, appearing at the jharokha at sunrise, applying tika on the foreheads of subordinate kings, or having himself weighed against gold or silver on his birthday. His abstention from music appears to have been a personal matter that was not imposed on others. 84 Other measures, such as prohibiting gambling or consuming alcohol, were intended to extend beyond the court, but they were blatantly ignored even by his closest courtiers. 85


He replaced the public celebration of the Persian New Year (Nauruz) with that of ‘Eid al-Fitr,


Under Shah Jahan, Hindus comprised less than a quarter (22.4 per cent) of all nobles holding a rank of 1000 zat or higher. By the last years of ‘Alamgir’s reign that figure had risen to nearly a third (31.6 per cent) of the total. 95


In keeping with the Mughal and Delhi sultanate precedent of viewing non-Muslim monuments within their sovereign domain as deserving of state protection, ‘Alamgir supported temples with cash or land grants. He once ordered officials in Benares to punish miscreants who had been harassing Brahmins in charge of that city’s Hindu temples. 96 And he described the temple complex of Ellora, which he visited in the 1650s, as ‘one of the marvels of the work of the true transcendent Artisan [God]’. 97 But his treatment of temples patronized by, or associated with, state enemies was another matter. Muslim sovereigns since the late twelfth century, and Hindu rajas since at least the seventh, had looted, redefined or destroyed royal temples of enemy kings as the normal means of detaching defeated rulers from the most prominent manifestations of their former sovereign authority, thereby rendering such rulers politically impotent. 98 For the Mughals, temples formerly patronized by enemy kings became state property once that king had been defeated and his former territory annexed to the empire. However, if a Hindu patron of such a temple rebelled against the state, both he and the temple were liable for punishment. Such a principle would explain ‘Alamgir’s destruction of temples in Kuch Bihar (north of Bengal) after local rajas there defied Mughal authority in 1661. The same principle accounted for his destruction of the Vishvanath Temple in Benares in 1669: people related to that temple’s patron were believed to have facilitated Shivaji’s escape from Agra, and hence were state enemies. Similarly, the Keśavaḍeva Temple in Mathura, which had been supported by imperial grants and was therefore considered state property, was destroyed in 1670 in the wake of a serious Jat rebellion in the region that claimed the life of the city’s commandant and patron of its congregational mosque. Moreover, three Brahmins in Mathura had harboured the son of Shivaji shortly after the latter had escaped detention in Agra. In 1679–80 ‘Alamgir ordered the destruction of prominent temples in Rajasthan–including Khandela, Udaipur and Jodhpur–once it was established that they, too, had been associated with anti-state rebels. 99


‘Alamgir’s India–unlike South Asia in the colonial and post-colonial eras–appears to have been conceptually integrated even while culturally diverse. This much is seen in the memoir of Bhimsen, who portrays the India of his day, the late seventeenth century, as filled with the great cities of the ‘heaven-protected’ Mughal empire as well as with the seven famous rivers and the seven sacred centres of Hindu mythic geography. At the symbolic centre of that seamlessly interwoven realm, and holding it together conceptually, stood ‘Alamgir, sacred king and heir to the spiritual charisma of his Timurid ancestors. 102 Bhimsen describes an incident during the monsoon of 1697 when the Bhima flooded its banks at ‘Alamgir’s camp at Machnur, drowning many people and bringing its waters to within a metre of the emperor’s tent. With the whole camp plunged in a state of distress, the emperor wrote a prayer on a slip of paper and cast it on the river’s surface. The water immediately subsided and, records Bhimsen, ‘the prayer of the God-devoted Emperor was accepted by God, and the world became composed again’. 103 What actually happened on that day we will never know with certainty; but Bhimsen’s memoir suggests how Indians of ‘Alamgir’s own time interpreted the meaning of the great flood of 1697.104


‘Alamgir’s support of the clerical establishment was symbolized by the most ambitious monument he ever patronized: Lahore’s splendid Badshahi Mosque (1671–3), for more than three centuries the largest mosque in the world [see Fig. 18].


Until the 1770s, when East India Company officials codified separate legal systems for Muslims and Hindus, Islamic law as it was administered in Mughal courts had functioned as common law.


‘Alamgir’s character was defined by many qualities, some of them contradictory. From an early age he showed remarkable courage, which was repeatedly displayed on battlefields. A steely sense of duty and self-discipline translated into a lifelong commitment to administrative detail, if not minutiae; in modern times he might be called a workaholic. His court historian Muhammad Kazim records that he slept only three hours a night. 118 The Italian traveller Manucci corroborates this observation, adding that he sat up until midnight ‘unceasingly occupied’ with official business. 119 Yet his devotion to work also prevented him from delegating authority to others and led to meddling in the affairs of his officers and his sons.


why did he spend a quarter-century relentlessly pursuing two Deccan sultanates and the Marathas–a futile enterprise that even contemporaries such as Bhimsen knew was running the empire into the ground? One answer lies in his obsessively industrious character. It was due to his focus, dedication, discipline and tenacity that the emperor held court twice daily, micro-managing nearly everything, personally reviewing and signing off on the most routine documents. But the virtue of tenacity could also become the defect of stubbornness, as seen in his refusal to change policy paths or his inability to discern larger geopolitical patterns. ‘Alamgir’s indefatigable industriousness might have served him well had he been a clerk or middle-level functionary in the Mughals’ vast bureaucracy. 121 But good political leadership requires vision, imagination and flexibility, which were not ‘Alamgir’s strengths. For twenty-five ruinous years he remained trapped in a quagmire of his own making, constitutionally unable to imagine a way forwards beyond his Sisyphean task of doggedly pursuing the Marathas, fort by fort. Another possible answer to the enigma of ‘Alamgir is hinted at by the Italian traveller Giovanni Careri, who in 1695 was granted a private audience with the emperor at one of his Deccan camps. The foreigner afterwards reflected on the underlying reasons for the emperor’s long and fruitless Deccan campaign: fearing with much reason the perverse Inclination of his Sons, he had continu’d in Arms in the Field for 15 Years; and particularly four Years at Galgala [Galgali, on the Krishna], after defeating [Prince] Akbar. He said his Father Sciah-Gehan [Shah Jahan] had not so much discretion; for he might have learnt by many years’ Experience, that the Kings of Indostan when they grow Old, must keep at the head of Powerful Armies, to defend themselves against their Sons. 122


the time Bahadur Shah died in 1712, the institution of princely households had deteriorated even further. All four of his sons were adults at the time their father came to power and, since they all wished to be at the imperial court at the start of the next, inevitable succession struggle, they simply refused to serve in the provinces as governors. For the first time in Mughal history, all princes remained at court for the duration of their father’s reign. But doing so compromised their ability to establish independent power bases, build alliances, tap into provincial revenue streams or acquire the administrative experience that might enhance the likelihood of a vigorous and successful reign.


But between 1700 and 1707 Tarabai, governing the kingdom as regent for her infant son, co-ordinated the defence of Maratha strongholds against ‘Alamgir’s armies while establishing a permanent Maratha presence in parts of Khandesh, Malwa and Gujarat.


Maratha chieftains soon split between supporters of Shahu, the son of Shivaji’s first son Sambhaji, and Tarabai, the widow of Shivaji’s second son Rajaram.


The office of peshwa soon swelled into the Peshwas–that is, a line of hereditary Brahmin rulers whose authority would ultimately displace that of the Maratha king himself. At the same time, Brahmins entered the Maratha state’s political economy at all levels.


By 1737 his armies managed to drive north as far as Delhi itself. Neither Muhammad Shah’s decaying government in Delhi nor Nizam al-Mulk’s in Aurangabad could halt the Peshwa. By January 1739 Nizam al-Mulk had acknowledged the Marathas’ complete sovereignty in Malwa and in all lands between the Narmada and the Chambal River, which runs a mere forty-five kilometres south of Agra. Later that year the Persian warlord Nadir Shah marched through the Khyber Pass with 150,000 cavalry, defeated a much larger Mughal army and sacked a supine, defenceless Delhi. Like Timur more than three centuries earlier, he chose not to remain in India, returning to Iran with caravans laden with looted gold, silver and jewellery worth 1.5 million rupees, including the famed Koh-i-Noor, and, not least, Shah Jahan’s priceless Peacock Throne. With such celebrated symbols of imperial glory for ever stripped from Indian soil, the Marathas were suddenly awakened to the reality that the Mughals were not, in fact, their enemy. Rather, they now saw the house of Babur as the key symbol of Indian sovereignty, to be defended from foreign invaders at all costs. To this end, Baji Rao proposed that all the powers of north India join a confederation to protect India’s Timurid dynasty, making the Peshwa almost resemble a proto-nationalist figure. For several decades, a cornerstone of Maratha policy was to pose as the Mughals’ truest defenders, at least at the imperial level.


Ahmad Shah Abdali, an Afghan warlord whose army had entered the Punjab and asserted Afghan territorial claims to the province. With a major showdown between the Marathas and Afghans in the air, in December the next year the Peshwa, Nana Saheb, began moving his own army northwards, aiming to join the main Maratha force then camped at Panipat, the historic battlefield north of Delhi. But he never got there. In mid January 1761, an estimated 50,000 Marathas were slaughtered at Panipat in one of the greatest military debacles in Indian history. For the Peshwa personally, the disaster represented a bitter indictment of decades of his and his predecessors’ forward policy in north India. Upon hearing the news while still en route to join the battle, the Peshwa turned round and headed back to Pune, a disillusioned and broken man. Within six months he was dead. The entire Maratha project north of Maharasthra had become either stalled or reversed.


whereas the Marathas initially resisted the Mughals but ended up defending the crippled empire, with the Sikhs it was the reverse.


His solution was dramatic. In 1699 he declared that the lineage of gurus would end with himself, thereby resolving the issue of any future succession struggles, and that his spiritual authority would henceforth be invested in a new, self-governing corporate body, the Khalsa, sworn by rites of initiation and dedicated to undertaking certain reforms.


accommodate the host of followers who had arrived from the plains, the Sikhs at Anandpur had been raiding richer, nearby villages for supplies. This, in turn, angered the hill rajas, who in 1704 (or 1705) subjected Anandpur to a protracted siege. 26 The rajas also appealed to the Mughals to intervene in the conflict. 27 As a consequence of the siege, Guru Gobind and his followers were ultimately forced to abandon the town and its forts. But in the confusion that followed, Mughal authorities captured and killed the guru’s two youngest sons, notwithstanding the government’s sworn promise to ensure the Sikhs’ safe passage from Anandpur. The aggrieved guru then appealed directly to ‘Alamgir for redress, using an extraordinary medium–a long Persian poem in which he defiantly censured the Mughals for their perfidy. He also demanded a personal meeting with the emperor to obtain justice and, more generally, to sort out Sikh–Mughal relations. 28 ‘Alamgir agreed and ordered his officials in the Punjab to arrange for the guru’s safe passage to his court in the Deccan. After Guru Gobind left the Punjab, however, news arrived that in March 1707 ‘Alamgir had died. But the guru proceeded anyway, meeting Bahadur Shah in Delhi as he was consolidating his power there, and then accompanying the new emperor to the Deccan. There, in 1708, the guru himself died, leaving the community momentarily leaderless so soon after the Khalsa institution had been launched.


Banda’s fiercely anti-Mughal rebellion elicited anything but a unified response across Punjabi society.


Nadir Shah’s 1739 raid on north India and sacking of Delhi clearly exposed the Mughals’ increasingly feeble condition under Muhammad Shah. 37 Then in 1748 Ahmad Shah Abdali, the powerful Afghan warlord, made the first of seventeen annual raids on north India. Although the Mughals repulsed the first of these, just four years later matters had deteriorated such that the Mughal governor of the Punjab agreed to send his land revenue to Ahmad Shah rather than to Delhi.


The growth of Muslim communities along the Bengal frontier was thus a by-product of interconnected political, economic and ultimately geomorphological processes. Having assisted the grantee in clearing the forests, the latter’s dependants continued to serve the institution the grantee had established by cultivating the lands included in the grant. Each new mosque in the forest thus became the nucleus for a new community of Muslim cultivators.


A similar combination of peasantization and Islamization occurred in the western Punjab, a process that began in the thirteenth century but was not complete until the eighteenth. Like eastern Bengal, western Punjab had for centuries lain on the margins of expansive, Delhi-based empires. And like the indigenous communities of eastern Bengal, Jat pastoralists in the western Punjab had been only partially incorporated into a Hindu socio-religious world at the time of their earliest contact with Muslims. Finally, as in eastern Bengal, the growth of Islam in the western Punjab occurred in tandem with a transition to settled agriculture–specifically, as Jat clans began to abandon full-time pastoralism and take up settled wheat-farming. However, whereas Islamization in eastern Bengal had been launched and sustained by hundreds of humble, thatched mosques established by forest-clearing developers, in the Punjab this role was played by large, state-supported shrine complexes that had been built over the grave sites of renowned Sufi shaikhs. Located along the banks of the southern and western Punjab’s rivers–the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej–these shrines were socio-cultural magnets, attracting large numbers of Jat communities for whom they provided a range of socio-economic and religious services.


As Jat clans entered into political, religious and marital relations with shrines such as that of Baba Farid, the names they gave their children reveal a gradual adoption of an Islamic identity. As early as the fifteenth century, Muslim names began to appear among Jat tribes associated with Baba Farid’s shrine, but they did not become dominant among those tribes until the early eighteenth, indicating a very slow and apparently unconscious process of Islamization. 52


Quite significantly, these socio-religious movements in eastern Bengal and western Punjab created the two largest Muslim communities in pre-British India, which would ultimately comprise the core of two post-British states: Bangladesh and Pakistan. The two communities shared a similar historical trajectory in that, in both, the evolution of an Islamic religious identity was associated with a transition to sedentary agrarian life among communities only lightly touched by Hindu culture.


In early December 1572, during his first attempt at conquering Gujarat, Akbar visited the ancient seaport of Cambay, at the time the region’s principal window on the outside world. Upon being welcomed at a pleasant spot by a delegation of foreign merchants–Turks from the Ottoman world, Persians from Safavid Iran, possibly some Portuguese–the emperor and a select body of men embarked on a ship. This brief excursion out on the water had no military or commercial purpose. It was made, records Abu’l-fazl, merely ‘to witness the spectacle of the ocean’. 53 Never before had any ruler in Akbar’s direct line of descent, going back to Timur himself, seen the ocean. But from this moment on, the Mughals would learn what peoples in coastal India had long known: that the sea was a source of wealth and power.


A vigorous Catholic mission in Goa carried religious ideas to Akbar’s court in Agra. New crops that the Portuguese brought from America–for example potatoes, maize, chillies, squash and tomatoes–utterly transformed the Indian diet. Europe’s direct maritime connection with India also facilitated technological transfers, as when Deccani engineers applied the idea of swivel cannon, which the Portuguese had mounted on their ships’ gunwales, to the massive cannon that were then positioned atop the Deccan’s hill forts.


In 1615 one observer estimated the Mughals’ annual revenue at 120 million silver coins, compared to forty-five million for the Ottoman empire and just fifteen million for neighbouring Iran. 59 In fact, between 1600 and 1800 India absorbed about 20 per cent of the precious metals produced throughout the world.


By the end of the sixteenth century the Mughal empire had undergone a second transformation as it became integrated with a global economy, symbolized by Akbar’s capture of Gujarat, India’s most highly commercialized subregion.


For the Mughal empire was no mighty juggernaut, crushing everything in its path. On the contrary, despite its image as an absolute monarchy, Mughal officials co-operated with numerous stakeholders, making alliances with, and working through, countless petty zamindars and other local elites. 65 Such officials were in no position to coerce merchants or others with whom they shared de facto sovereignty. 66 Far less did they establish strict production schedules for labourers, impose maximum wages for producers or restrict their mobility. Yet these were the very kinds of mercantalist measures that employees of the English East India Company considered fundamental for maximizing their profits.


Because their northern location and temperate climate prevented them from cultivating cotton, Europeans for centuries had clothed themselves in wool or linen. Spanish Arabs introduced cotton to Europeans in the tenth and eleventh centuries–the English word for the fibre is derived from the Arabic qutun–and from the twelfth century northern Italy supported a modest textile industry based on raw cotton imported from across the Mediterranean Sea. A strong demand for cotton products did not take hold in northern Europe, however, until after the establishment of direct maritime contact with India, which had been the world’s leading manufacturer of cotton for more than five millennia. 67 This demand grew steadily through the seventeenth century. In 1664 alone, the English East India Company imported a quarter of a million pieces of cloth, nearly half of them from Coromandel, a third from Gujarat and less than a fifth from Bengal. Twenty years later the Company was annually importing 1.76 million pieces of Indian textiles to England, which represented 83 per cent of the Company’s total trade.


Nor was this just an English craze. Indian textiles occupied the centre of a global phenomenon that transformed the economies and societies of five continents. By the dawn of the eighteenth century, India’s cotton textiles had displaced rice and spices as the principal item of trade in the Indian Ocean. And by the mid eighteenth century, when more than three-quarters of all the English East India Company’s imports from India consisted of textiles, Asia, Europe, Africa and the two Americas were all tightly integrated by the white fibre and the textiles spun from it. To


from the mid eighteenth century, Indian rulers, in order to advance their own fortunes on an increasingly fragmented political stage, willingly surrendered revenue-collection rights in return for access to European weapons and/ or European-trained soldiers. Such rights became the principal mechanism by which the English company would leverage its commercial operations into outright domination over Indian territory.


These processes began quietly enough in the 1750s along the Coromandel coast. There, rivalry between the French and English companies intensified when each company backed opposing claimants to succeed as the nawab of Arcot, a remnant of ‘Alamgir’s conquests in the south-eastern Deccan. In 1763, after armed forces of the British East India Company defeated those of the French company for commercial hegemony in the region, the British-backed nawab became heavily indebted to his European sponsors and surrendered to the British company the revenue-collecting rights to lands adjacent to its base at Madras. Later called Chingleput District, this region was styled the Company’s jagir. The use of this Mughal administrative term suggested that the British were merely servants of the nawab of Arcot, who in theory ruled under the authority of the nizam of Hyderabad, who governed the Deccan theoretically as governor (subahdar) of the emperor in Delhi. In this way the Company inserted itself on India’s political map, albeit at the bottom of a largely fictitious chain of political authority that stretched from Delhi down to Chingleput.


In 1756 the British company had refused to obey the provincial nawab’s orders to cease building fortifications, which were driven, again, by Anglo-French rivalry. In response, the impetuous twenty-three-year-old nawab seized the British company’s base of Calcutta. The following year Robert Clive, a military officer who had already played a leading role in the Company’s territorial acquisitions in Coromandel, was ordered to sail from Madras and recover the city. After accomplishing that goal, Clive, being well beyond the reach of Company or Parliamentary checks on his ambition, exceeded the terms of his authorized mission by conspiring with the nawab’s disaffected commander-in-chief to overthrow the unpopular nawab. In June 1757 he defeated the nawab’s forces 150 kilometres north of Calcutta and then installed his native co-conspirator as Bengal’s new Mughal nawab, who then became in effect a Company puppet.


the 1765 Diwani of Bengal had set a precedent for what would subsequently happen elsewhere in India: the acquisition of de facto governing authority not through outright conquest but through mutual agreements concluded between regional powers and an overseas trading company–albeit a company authorized not just to monopolize trade but to mint coins, exercise justice and wage war. Moreover, the Company’s acquisition of Bengal’s public finance meant that it could use that province’s revenues to help pay for its investments in the region’s goods for export,


Although coastal tracts first felt the impact of imported silver, the coined metal quickly diffused into India’s hinterland, owing, among other things, to the overall structure of the textile industry. Whereas cloth was woven, bleached, dyed and printed in coastal regions, the raw cotton was grown, harvested, cleaned and spun into yarn deep in the interior. Bengal depended on yarn from Gujarat, Coromandel acquired its cotton from the Deccan, Gujarat relied on raw silk transported from Bengal. The cotton grown on the black soils of the central Deccan was brought 400 kilometres to Coromandel by nomadic clans–the Banjaras–on huge caravans of 10,000–40,000 bullocks each. 77 The entire hinterland of Madras was devoted to supplying rice to coastal markets and their weaving communities. 78 As a result, the growth of maritime commerce stimulated India’s land-based economy both in the hinterland and along the coast.


Ultimately, what enabled growing European influence in the second half of the eighteenth century in India was local demand for European weaponry or mercenaries, which Europeans happily supplied. A single incident suggests the general trend. In April 1758 the acting governor of Portuguese Goa wrote to Tarabai, at that time the aged dowager of the Maratha kingdom, that he would be most pleased to supply her with the 2,000 guns she had ordered, provided she paid for them before delivery. 80 Tarabai duly furnished the cash, drawn from the accumulated stocks of silver that had been flowing into Indian coasts for the previous two and a half centuries. Did such deals constitute a significant break with the past? Many historians have seen the mid eighteenth century as a major–if not the major–point of rupture in the flow of Indian history. Yet the entry of Europeans as political actors was built upon long-established Indian institutions. One of these were the well-developed revenue-extracting bureaucracies that were still operating at local levels, even if the Mughal central government was not receiving those revenues. Another was India’s long-standing and extensive military labour market. For centuries before the mid 1700s, ambitious Indian rulers or would-be rulers had been buying into indigenous markets of military labour in order to advance their claims to political authority. From the mid eighteenth century onwards, however, those same figures began contracting European-trained military labour or, as in the case of Tarabai’s dealings with the acting governor of Goa, European weaponry. Yet the reverse also occurred, as both Frenchmen and–more successfully–Englishmen tapped into India’s indigenous military labour market. ‘British conquest’, writes the historian C. A. Bayly, ‘often meant no more than the slow drift to the East India Company of soldiers, merchants and administrators, leaving the Indian rulers with nothing more than a husk of royal grandeur.’ 81


Persian had been the pre-eminent language of diplomatic discourse in India. Even before the Mughal age, Lodi rulers had employed members of Hindu scribal communities and issued bilingual revenue documents in Persian and Hindavi. 1 During the Afghan interregnum that followed the Mughal conquest, Sher Shah appointed two writers (karkuns) for each district, one for Persian and one for Hindavi. 2 The big breakthrough, however, came in 1582 when Akbar, with the apparent aim of promoting a political culture that would arch over the Mughal realm’s diverse religious and cultural communities, established Persian as the official language.


By 1700 India was probably the world’s leading centre for the patronage of Persian literature and scholarship, with an estimated seven times more people literate in Persian than in Iran.


It is not coincidental that the Persian word for ‘dictionary’, farhang, also means ‘good breeding’, ‘greatness’ or ‘education’.


The Mughal court then not only lavishly patronized that canon, but endeavoured to place India at the centre of the wider Persophone world. It was to this end that Akbar commissioned the compilation of a comprehensive Persian dictionary, the Farhang-i Jahangiri, so called because it was completed in 1606 during Jahangir’s reign. The compilers of this work of some 9,000 entries consulted forty-four dictionaries in the course of its making, thereby seeking to consolidate all previous lexicographical efforts and embrace the entirety of the Persian language.


The Persianate was not the only cosmopolitan tradition that flourished in the Mughal period. More than any of the Indian sultanates that preceded them, the Mughals staked their claims to sovereignty by engaging with Sanskrit literary traditions. By appropriating a culture deeply rooted in India’s pre-Persianate past, they saw themselves as Indian kings and wished to be seen as such by others. It is therefore hardly surprising that both Brahmin and Jain scholars maintained a significant presence in the Mughal court in the latter decades of Akbar’s reign and continuing through those of Jahangir and Shah Jahan. 29


Among such inter-cosmopolitan projects, the most ambitious were the court-commissioned Persian translations of the great Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, which Akbar sponsored from the 1580s.


Among all spheres of culture, it was perhaps in the sciences that knowledge passed most freely between the Persianate and Sanskritic worlds. In


By ‘Alamgir’s reign, Avicenna’s theories had become Indianized as Hindus who had learnt Persian engaged with them. At the same time, Ayurvedic medicine became Persianized as it gained influence in the courts of the Deccan and north India.


Persian polymath Nasir al-Din Tusi, who persuaded his Mongol overlords to support the construction of a massive observatory at Maragheh (1259), in north-west Iran, together with a library and teams of scholars, to test Greek principles against empirical observation. In 1429 Timur’s grandson, Ulugh Beg (d. 1449), built another such observatory in Samarqand, modelled on that at Maragheh.


by ‘Alamgir’s reign Persianate notions of astronomy had stimulated considerable intellectual ferment in Sanskrit circles, forcing scholars either to defend, modify or reject their inherited tradition.


Ulugh Beg’s observatory in Samarqand also inspired Jai Singh II (r. 1700–43), the Rajput raja of Amber and high-ranking Mughal mansabdar, to build a number of his own observatories, including those in Delhi and Jaipur, the eponymous capital city he founded. Unlike the pundits at Benares, who were divided over the acceptability of non-Indian astronomy, Jai Singh enthusiastically studied Brahmanical and Perso-Arabic systems and patronized scholars of both traditions at his court. In Jaipur between 1728 and 1732, just as Mughal central authority was dissolving and provincial governments were assuming de facto independence, a Persian scholar collaborated with a Brahmin pundit in translating the works of Tusi, Ptolemy and Euclid from Persian or Arabic into Sanskrit, through the medium of their common tongue, Hindavi. 40 Jai Singh himself wrote texts on astronomy in both Persian and Sanskrit, and his direct observations led him to modify astronomical calculations of Ulugh Beg, his Timurid predecessor. 41 Although the raja’s modifications of Perso-Arabic astronomical theory hardly represented a scientific breakthrough, his close engagement with Persianate science is nonetheless impressive, as is the stunning effect of his observatories, with their sweeping curves, on the landscapes of Delhi and Jaipur.

yet already in 1027 Biruni’s own patron, Mahmud of Ghazni, minted coins bearing a Sanskrit translation of the Islamic confession of faith in which the Prophet Muhammad was presented as an avatar of God, translated as avyaktam, ‘the Unmanifested’. 43 By using Sanskrit terms that roughly approximated the meaning of the Arabic, Mahmud was already blurring two very different theological spheres.


was natural for educated elites to view India’s history and material culture through the prism of universal kingship, rather than that of specific religions. Chandar Bhan’s seventeenth-century history of the kings of Delhi seamlessly connected the Mughals and Delhi sultans to their north Indian royal predecessors, something Biruni could never have imagined.


the success of vernacular Braj as a literary form carried serious implications for the patronage and usage of Sanskrit. Keshavdas and his many successors in seventeenth-and eighteenth-century India contributed to a larger process by which Braj, by appropriating Sanskrit style, began to encroach upon the cultural space that Sanskrit had once monopolized, eventually usurping its place and rendering the classical language increasingly irrelevant.


as Delhi’s economic and political importance continued to decline after the mid eighteenth century, many of the city’s poets migrated to the empire’s former provinces–Bengal, Bihar, Awadh, Punjab, Hyderabad–where they acquired students wishing to emulate the new metropolitan poetic style called rekhtah. Written in Persian script and appropriating Persian literary models, this new style was composed in the vernacular dialect of the Delhi region and evoked the lustre of the Mughals’ remembered, glorious past. In particular, it was associated with the prestige of the imperial Mughal camp, or urdu, by which name the language would be known.


The reigns of two Mughal emperors in particular–Akbar and ‘Alamgir–saw distinctive, but very different, harbingers of what people in the twenty-first century might call modernity. Akbar’s reign exhibited a spirit of rational self-control and a nearly obsessive preoccupation with order in all spheres of experience, especially in governance and administration.


Record-keeping from Akbar’s reign onwards was meticulous, as strict rules were established for maintaining data and auditing accounts.


The imperial court’s endeavour to set the tone for an empire-wide ethos of discipline and rational order is neatly epitomized by a water-clock that Akbar maintained in his palace in Fatehpur Sikri. There, orderlies would strike loud bronze gongs as each quarter-hour had elapsed.


After winning the throne, therefore, ‘Alamgir endeavoured to replace Dara’s and his ancestors’ cult of sacred kingship with something entirely new in Mughal history. Instead of a state that pivoted on a charismatic, sacred emperor, he tried to establish an impersonal polity governed by the rule of law, for which purpose he gave sweeping powers to the Mughal judiciary and patronized the production of the Fatawa-i ‘Alamgiri, a comprehensive and authoritative legal compendium of Hanifi Sunni Islam that was promulgated throughout the empire.


In very different ways, then, the long, half-century reigns of both Akbar and ‘Alamgir set India on a path towards modernity well before European colonial rule took hold in South Asia. The former sovereign established principles of efficiency, discipline and rational order at every level of governance, and the latter laid out a vision of a state run by the impersonal rule of law rather than the whims of a sacred sovereign.

## A Little History of Economics, - Niall Kishtainy


The word ‘economics’ might sound a bit dry, and make you think of a load of boring statistics. But all it’s really about is how to help people to survive and to be healthy and educated. It’s about how people get what they need to live full, happy lives–and why some people don’t. If we can solve basic economic questions, maybe we can help everyone to live better lives.

The British economist Lionel Robbins once defined economics as the study of scarcity. Rare things like diamonds and white peacocks are scarce, but to economists pens and books are scarce too, even though you can easily find them at home or in your local shop. By scarcity they mean that there’s a limited amount, and people’s desires are potentially unlimited.

Economics, then, is about how we use scarce resources to satisfy needs. But it’s more than this. How do the choices facing people change? Those in poor societies face stark ones: a meal for the children or antibiotics for a sick grandmother. In rich countries like America or Sweden they rarely do. They might have to choose between a new watch and the latest iPad.

Most consumers are also workers because they earn money from a job. Firms, workers and consumers are the key elements of an economy. But banks and stock markets–the ‘financial system’–also influence how resources are used. Banks lend money to firms–they ‘finance’ them. When one lends money to a clothes manufacturer to build a new factory, the loan allows the manufacturer to buy cement, which ends up as part of the factory rather than in a new bridge. To raise money, companies sometimes sell ‘shares’ (or ‘stock’) in the stock market. When you own a share in Toshiba you own a tiny bit of the company and if Toshiba does well the price of its shares rise and you get richer.

It’s said that one night he dreamt of a swan spreading its wings and flying away while hooting loudly. The next day he met Plato, the man who would become his star pupil. Socrates saw in Plato the swan of his dream. The pupil became a teacher of humanity, his thought soaring high and wide for centuries to come.

Plato feared that if wealth became too important people would start to compete for it. Eventually the state would be ruled by the rich who’d be envied by the poor.

Making money out of money by lending it to someone for a price (for an ‘interest rate’) is the most unnatural economic activity possible; as we’ll see in the next chapter, Aristotle’s attack on moneylending influenced economic thinking for centuries to come. To Aristotle, then, it was clear that virtue lay with the honest farmers, not the clever bankers. As Plato and Aristotle

At the beginning of the eleventh century the pope said that merchants could never enter heaven. At the end of the following century the pope made a merchant called Homobonus a saint. The idea that to be close to God you had to be poor started to die out. Jesus told his disciples that they couldn’t serve both God and money, but by the time of Aquinas the merchants believed that they could. In 1253 an Italian firm began its handwritten accounts with the words ‘In the name of God and of profit’. God’s economy was merging with the new world of commerce.

Today we measure how rich a nation is in terms of the amount of food, clothes and other goods that its businesses produce. We no longer pay for things using gold. Instead we use ‘paper money’: pound notes and dollar bills which in themselves are worthless. Our coins, too, are made out of cheap metals worth much less than the actual value of the coins.

As explorers and armies conquered new lands, rulers gave merchants the right to trade with the territories. Sea voyages were risky, so a single person wouldn’t want to finance them alone. Rulers allowed the merchants to set up special companies in which a group of investors each contributed money and each received a share of the profits. The companies led the push into the foreign lands, earning wealth and fame for themselves and their rulers. The English East India Company, founded in 1600, of which Mun was an official, was one of them. The company turned into a powerful organisation and helped England to establish an empire in India.

For example, instead of trying to make as much money as possible, bakers would ensure that their neighbours had enough bread for their dinner. Butchers would take on new assistants not because they really needed them, but because their friends needed jobs. Everyone would be nice to each other and society would be a place of harmony. Smith turned this upside down. He argued that society does well when people act in their own self-interest. Instead of trying to be nice all the time, do what’s best for you and in the end more people will benefit. ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest,’ he said.

The production of a labourer’s cheap shirt depends on the efforts of many people and machines doing specialised tasks: wool spinners to make the thread, weavers to create the cloth and tailors to sew on the buttons. Then think of the people who chopped the wood to make the loom on which the fabric was woven and the miners who dug the iron to make the nails of the ship on which the finished shirt was transported. The work of thousands went into the shirt. Together their actions form a vast social mechanism, each piece moving with the others like those of a clock to deliver the shirt onto the body of the labourer exactly when he wants it. Smith

To Smith, the wealth of a nation was the entire amount of useful goods–wheat, beer, shirts, books–that a country’s economy produces for the people. This is how today’s economists think of it. A nation’s income (its ‘national income’) is the total value of all the goods that a country’s businesses make.

Ricardo therefore concluded that ‘the interest of the landlord is always opposed to the interest of every other class in the community’. The power of the landlords dragged down the economy, Ricardo said. When capitalists build factories and hire workers to make and grow things, they increase production in the economy. But with lower profits the capitalists have less to spend and so wealth creation slows down. Landowners get rich simply by collecting rent on the land. Instead of investing their income like the capitalists, they consume it on maids and butlers, on libraries for their mansions,

‘marginal utility’. Imagine eating a toffee. You love it. It gives you a lot of satisfaction, or ‘utility’, as economists call it. But as you eat more toffees the pleasure you get from an extra one won’t be as great. The tenth toffee is nice, but not as nice as the first. After eating fifteen toffees you start to tire of them. Perhaps the twentieth toffee gives you no pleasure at all. The pleasure from an extra toffee is its marginal utility. ‘Margin’ means the edge of something, so the ‘edge’ of your utility from toffees is the utility of the very last one you ate. The tendency of marginal utility to go down as you consume more is known as the ‘principle of diminishing marginal utility’.

The demand curve slopes downwards: as the price decreases people want more. A ‘supply curve’ links price with the quantity that firms produce. The supply curve slopes upwards: as the price rises firms become willing to make more spoons because the higher price covers the increased cost of production.

List’s proposal was to shield new industries from foreign competition. One way is to put a tax or ‘tariff’ on foreign goods. A German tariff on British steel makes British steel costlier for Germans. If the tariff is high enough then it makes British steel more expensive than German steel. People would then buy German steel and so Germany’s infant steel industry would survive. Economists call this policy ‘protection’.

‘welfare economics’. It examines the overall benefit to society that comes from all the decisions made, those that people make about buying, selling and working, and that firms make about production and employment. This is part of ‘normative economics’, the branch of economics that allows you to judge an economic situation, here whether a market is performing well or badly.

In Keynes’s theory, the income of a country isn’t what the economy is able to produce. How can it be, when so many factories and workers lie idle that the economy is producing much less than it’s able to? Instead, income is the amount that people spend, what they ‘demand’. When I buy your hats, I give you an income. When we all spend less, fewer goods are bought and fewer get made. The nation’s income is therefore lower. From this starting point, Keynes created a new explanation of recessions and unemployment.

When investors stop investing they stop borrowing people’s savings as loans. That means there’s a large supply of savings available for loan but little demand for them. When the supply of anything is bigger than what people demand, then its price falls. In this case, the price of the loan, the interest rate, falls. The lower interest rate encourages investors to borrow the savings to spend on new machines and factories. The result is that excess savings–the water backed up in the hose–always gets turned into a new flow of investment. Again the water level stays where it is.

recessions happen when more flows out of the bath than flows in. What happens is that businesspeople start to feel gloomy about the future and stop investing. That means that the amount of spending flowing into the economy as investment is less than that flowing out as savings.

recessions are caused by people saving rather than spending–what we often say is the sensible thing to do. The problem, then, is people being a bit too sensible! ‘Whenever you save five shillings, you put a man out of work for a day,’ said Keynes.

Schumpeter thought that monopolies helped the economy to advance. Economists usually view monopolies as inefficient because they charge too much and produce too little. They recognise a few exceptions, though. In some industries huge investments need to be made to begin producing a good. A water supplier has to lay a network of pipes before it can supply any water, for example. A single firm supplying the whole market can spread the costs of the pipes over a large output and so supply water at a low cost. It would be much more expensive for ten firms to each lay their own network of pipes to supply a tenth of the market. Schumpeter believed that monopolies were especially important for bringing about innovation because they give entrepreneurs big rewards for the risky activity of trying to create new things.

A single firm supplying the whole market can spread the costs of the pipes over a large output and so supply water at a low cost. It would be much more expensive for ten firms to each lay their own network of pipes to supply a tenth of the market. Schumpeter believed that monopolies were especially important for bringing about innovation because they give entrepreneurs big rewards for the risky activity of trying to create new things.

Game theorists call it ‘strategic interaction’: we affect each other (we ‘interact’) and so we decide what to do in the light of what our enemy does (we’re ‘strategic’). Game theory is the study of strategic interactions that are found everywhere, from simple games like rock-paper-scissors to the search for profit by businesses and the wars fought between nations.

In fact Nash’s idea became the most important in game theory, still used all the time today. He said that the outcome of a game–its ‘equilibrium’–is that in which each player does the best for himself given what the other player does. When everyone’s doing that, no one has any reason to change what they’re doing, so that’s the equilibrium of the game. Nash proved that most games have an equilibrium–what became known as a ‘Nash equilibrium’. Take me and my enemy. Given that my enemy buys missiles, then my best response is to do the same: the worst thing would be to be unarmed in the face of enemy threats. The same reasoning applies to my enemy:

In business, politics and life, people sometimes compete and sometime cooperate. Game theory provides a way of thinking about that complexity. When are people likely to try to work together and when will they fight tooth and nail?

The doomsday machine illustrates a basic lesson of game theory: influencing what your opponent thinks about you is critical. A firm threatening to retaliate against a rival needs to show that it’s tough rather than weak. An economic equivalent of installing a doomsday machine is to build a much bigger factory than the market needs. Once built, it’s worth retaliating against competitors by flooding the market, even at rock-bottom prices, to get back some of the money spent building.

The problem is that to be profitable, a factory depends on there being other factories. To make money, a new sardine-canning factory needs to sell its sardines. Who’ll buy them? People in the traditional part of the economy earn very little and don’t have the money to buy tinned sardines. The factory’s own workers will spend some, not all, of their wages on them; they’ll want to buy shoes as well. If at the same time a shoe factory opened, then its workers would buy some sardines and the sardine factory’s workers would buy shoes. Each creates a market for the other’s products. For industrialisation to happen, then, workers need to be taken from the land and put into many different industries at the same time. Together the factories would be profitable, but on their own they wouldn’t be, so if you were a businessperson thinking about setting up a sardine factory, you’d be put off by a lack of other industries in the country. Ports, metal plants and shipyards depend on each other and need to be built together. Developing countries had to go from having nothing to having everything, and Rosenstein-Rodan argued that only the government could time the leap accurately. It had to make massive investments in many areas of the economy. He called it the ‘big push’.

Today economists constantly talk about ‘human capital’, the idea that people contribute to production like a machine does, and that people can enhance their human capital and job prospects by getting educational qualifications. People were outraged when Becker proposed the idea. Today, the notion that students go to university to gain skills that will help them get high-paying jobs when they graduate is barely questioned.

Solow–and in parallel with him, a now overlooked Australian economist, Trevor Swan (1918–89)–devised a theory to explain how economies grow during normal times when they’re using all available resources to produce goods. They ask us to imagine a simplified world in which goods are made using capital (machines and factories) and labour. A society can produce goods using different combinations of capital and labour: it could dig a train tunnel using a few mechanical diggers and hundreds of people with shovels, or using lots of mechanical diggers and only a few people to drive them. Rich countries are those with a lot of capital compared to the population. That means they’re able to produce a lot of output for each person. It’s output per person that’s the proper measure of how rich a society is. A society of ten people that produces goods worth £100 is twice as rich as a society of twenty producing the same amount. The society of ten can provide on average double the amount of goods to each of its people, and they have a higher standard of living than the society of twenty. Solow’s theory is about explaining growth in the crucial measure of income per person.

Diminishing returns to capital means that as an economy adds more to its stock of capital and produces more, its rate of growth tapers off. Eventually, all the gains from extra capital are exhausted. If capital was the only thing that created economic growth, then the economy would end up in a position in which there was no growth in income per person. In fact, there is something that creates growth in income per person in the long run: technological improvements. In economic terms, technology is a recipe that makes inputs, such as cloth, thread and metal, into outputs, such as a pair of jeans. The recipe is knowledge: how to cut cloth, how to sew the pieces together, and so on. Knowledge advances when someone invents a more efficient sewing technique. Jeans can then be made more easily. The economy becomes more ‘productive’. Technological progress allows more to be made with the capital and labour that a country has. It also creates completely new goods. Societies progress as they move from stone tablets to parchment, from parchment to paper and from paper to digital tablets. It’s higher productivity stemming from technological advancement, says Solow, which is the true engine of growth.

Prebisch said that this was wrong. Poor countries like Cuba tended to export ‘primary’ products such as sugar, coffee and bananas. Rich countries tended to export manufactured products like television sets and cars. When people get richer they spend more on television sets and cars but they don’t spend nearly as much extra on sugar and coffee.

Prebisch saw that this had a disturbing implication for poor countries. When the economy of a poor country grows, its demand for the cars that it imports from rich countries rises. But when a rich country grows, the country’s demand for the sugar that it imports from poor countries rises much more slowly. In consequence, the price of cars rises faster than the price of sugar: the poor country’s ‘terms of trade’ worsens. So when the population of the poor country demands more cars the country has to export ever more sugar to pay for them. It turns into a vicious cycle: the poor country specialises more in sugar production to pay for cars, but over time each tonne of sugar buys fewer cars. In the end the poor country can’t grow as fast as the rich country. A high rate of growth would create a high demand for cars that the country wouldn’t be able to satisfy with the revenues from its sugar exports. What a contrast with the cheerful outlook of the nineteenth-century economists! Now it seems that trade between rich and poor traps poor countries into exporting cheap sugar and coffee, and into always lagging behind the rich world.

What was the way out for poor countries? Prebisch said that they shouldn’t specialise, they should diversify–that is, make lots of different goods. They needed to produce sugar and coffee, and cars and television sets, too.

If people don’t spend, then the government must, said the Keynesians. It can stop the downward spiral by spending money on roads, on hospitals, on new pot plants for its offices, on pretty much anything in fact.

what the government does is to borrow the unspent savings that are sloshing around the economy and spend them itself; it redirects them back into the bath. In doing this, it spends more than it collects in taxes (a bit like when someone borrows money from a bank to buy a car and so spends more than they earn). The government runs a ‘budget deficit’. Later, when the economy picks up and more people are in work and earning money, the government collects a greater amount of taxes and the deficit disappears.

Another way is to cut taxes–Kennedy’s policy. It does much the same thing by putting more dollars in the hands of consumers. Even though consumers save some of the dollars, they also buy things, which pushes up spending in the economy.

Economists call any policy to do with government spending and taxing ‘fiscal’ policy. In ancient Rome, the fiscus was the treasure chest of the emperor, so fiscal policy is about the state filling up its coffers with taxes and emptying them by spending.

Another type of policy is ‘monetary’ policy: anything that alters the amount of money in the economy or the interest rate charged for borrowing it. The simplest type is the government printing more dollars.

The starting point is to see that people have choices about what to do with their wealth. They can choose to keep it as plain old money, simple notes and coins that don’t earn them any interest. Alternatively they can buy financial products like bonds. Bonds are certificates that pay interest to whoever owns them. Firms or governments sell them to the public when they want to borrow money. When there’s a high rate of interest on bonds then people don’t want to keep their wealth as money that doesn’t pay them interest–they’d rather buy bonds. In this case, we say that the demand for money is low. In contrast, when interest rates are low, people’s demand for money is high. Suppose now that the government prints more dollars (increases the supply of money). For people to hold on to the extra, rather than use it to buy bonds, the interest rate must fall. The fall makes the supply of money equal the demand for it. What’s important here is that the lower interest rate affects businesspeople’s decisions. It isn’t worth building a new factory that promises them a certain profit when they have to pay a lot of interest on the money they borrow to build it. But when the interest rate is low enough, it is worth it. So a lower interest rate stimulates business investment. That means more spending in the economy and so higher national income and more jobs.

That means more spending in the economy and so higher national income and more jobs.


The starting point is to see that people have choices about what to do with their wealth. They can choose to keep it as plain old money, simple notes and coins that don’t earn them any interest. Alternatively they can buy financial products like bonds. Bonds are certificates that pay interest to whoever owns them. Firms or governments sell them to the public when they want to borrow money. When there’s a high rate of interest on bonds then people don’t want to keep their wealth as money that doesn’t pay them interest–they’d rather buy bonds. In this case, we say that the demand for money is low. In contrast, when interest rates are low, people’s demand for money is high. Suppose now that the government prints more dollars (increases the supply of money). For people to hold on to the extra, rather than use it to buy bonds, the interest rate must fall. The fall makes the supply of money equal the demand for it. What’s important here is that the lower interest rate affects businesspeople’s decisions. It isn’t worth building a new factory that promises them a certain profit when they have to pay a lot of interest on the money they borrow to build it. But when the interest rate is low enough, it is worth it. So a lower interest rate stimulates business investment. That means more spending in the economy and so higher national income and more jobs.


Great Depression in the 1930s when interest rates were very low. If they were so low, why did the depression go on for so long, they wondered? They concluded that money and interest rates don’t affect overall demand in the economy that much. Keynesians came to believe that what really spurred investment was businesspeople’s feelings of optimism (what Keynes had called their ‘animal spirits’), not a low interest rate. The conventional

Politicians want to stay in power and so will do anything to avoid cutting spending and annoying them. In the end, spending keeps going up and up, and so does the government’s deficit. This is what Buchanan believed was happening in the 1960s.

To improve the government’s behaviour, Buchanan argues for constitutional rules such as one that makes it a legal requirement for the government not to spend more money than it collects in taxes–to have a ‘balanced budget’.

suppose that in May the Mexican government sets a price for pesos in dollars. If in June the demand for pesos is higher than usual, then the government can print more pesos to keep their value from rising above the price it set. But if in July people buy a lot of dollars, and so sell more pesos than usual, then the price of pesos is in danger of falling. To keep it up, the government must buy pesos using its stock of dollars. Economists call this stock a country’s ‘foreign currency reserves’; they’re crucial for regulating the level of exchange rate.

Sen argues that by better understanding how fluctuations in markets can cause famines, more can be done to prevent them. For example, in the early 1970s a drought led to agricultural workers losing their jobs in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The government employed them to build roads and dig wells, which gave them a wage and protected their food entitlements. Famine was therefore averted. Sen says that democracy and a free press are essential to preventing famines. When journalists can write about the hardship faced by the poor, the government has an incentive to do something about it, otherwise it risks getting voted out of power at the next election. Sen believes that this is why there’s been no famine in India since its independence. On the other hand, the biggest famine of the twentieth century–that in China in the late 1950s, in which 30 million people died–went on for so long and killed so many because journalists weren’t free to write what they wanted. The Chinese government had launched its Great Leap Forward programme that aimed to modernise the economy, part of which was a disastrous reorganisation of agriculture. Without anyone reporting what it was doing, the government was able to go on with its policies at the cost of so many lives.

‘signalling’ to each other. For example, firms want to hire the most productive people, but people’s ability is hard to observe. One way that people signal their ability is by obtaining educational qualifications. Pushing the idea further, education might not make people that much better at their jobs; qualifications merely help employers to distinguish between productive and unproductive people.

A surprising feature of a lot of standard economic theory is that it says little about money and banks, the very things that you might expect it to be about. This is because the basic theory of markets is to do with the buying and selling of real things. You sell me potatoes so that you can buy yourself a scarf; what matters is how many potatoes you need to sell to get a scarf. Here money smooths the swapping of potatoes for scarves, but on its own it doesn’t do much. To Minsky this was the wrong way round. Money, and the banks that help create it by making loans, are what power the economy–and what eventually lead it into a crisis.

At the start of our story we met the first people to think about economics: the philosophers of ancient Greece. They were concerned with life’s most fundamental questions, ones that we grapple with to this day. What does it take to live well in a human society? What do people need to be happy and fulfilled? What makes them truly thrive? That’s where economics started and, after all the arguments and disagreements, it’s where it must begin from again.

## How to Grow Old, Cicero


Everyone hopes to reach old age, but when it comes, most of us complain about it. People can be so foolish and inconsistent.


If old people are foolish, nothing can console them for time slipping away, no matter how long they live.


it: I follow nature as the best guide and obey her like a god. Since she has carefully planned the other parts of the drama of life, it’s unlikely that she would be a bad playwright and neglect the final


Older people who are reasonable, good-tempered, and gracious will bear aging well. Those who are mean-spirited and irritable will be unhappy at every period of their lives. 8. Laelius: That is undoubtedly true, Cato. But what if someone were to say that your wealth, property, and social standing—advantages in life that few people possess—are what have made growing older so pleasant for you?


It isn’t a light burden if a person, even a wise man, is poor. But if someone is a fool, all the money in the world won’t make aging easier.


Gorgias of Leontini reached his one hundred and seventh birthday, never resting from his studies and work. 18 When someone asked him why he wished to live so long, he replied, “I have no reason to complain about old age.” A noble answer, worthy of a scholar.


those who say a pilot does nothing useful for sailing a ship because others climb the masts, run along the gangways, and work the pumps while he sits quietly in the stern holding the rudder. He may not be doing what the younger crewmen are doing, but what he does is much more important and valuable. It’s not by strength or speed or swiftness of body that great deeds are done, but by wisdom, character, and sober judgment. These qualities are not lacking in old age but in fact grow richer as time passes.


I have certainly never heard of an old man who forgot where he hid his money! Old people remember what interests them, whether it be the dates to appear in court, who owes them money, or to whom they owe money.


for truly no one is so old that he doesn’t think he’ll live another year—


If you ask a farmer, however old he might be, whom he is planting for, he will always reply: “For the immortal gods, who have not only handed down to me these things from my ancestors but also determined that I should pass them on to my descendants.”


Caecilius said something even more striking: Indeed, Old Age, if you brought no evil but this alone, it would be enough—that a person by living long sees many things he does not wish to see.


Caecilius is even worse: I think the most unhappy thing about old age is feeling that you are wearisome to the young.


What indeed could be more pleasant than an old age surrounded by the enthusiasm of youth?


Nature has but a single path and you travel it only once. Each stage of life has its own appropriate qualities—weakness in childhood, boldness in youth, seriousness in middle age, and maturity in old age. These are fruits that must be harvested in due season.


But let us assume that old age makes us feeble—what does it matter? No one expects older people to be physically strong in any case. That is why both law and custom exempt men my age from public duties requiring bodily strength. We aren’t expected to perform tasks we cannot do nor even those things we can do.


We can do this by following a plan of healthy living, exercising in moderation, and eating and drinking just enough to restore our bodies without overburdening them. And as much as we should care for our bodies, we should pay even more attention to our minds and spirits. For they, like lamps of oil, will grow dim with time if not replenished. And even though physical exercise may tire the body, mental activity makes the mind sharper.


For old age is respected only if it defends itself, maintains its rights, submits to no one, and rules over its domain until its last breath.


Once, while he was sitting by his fireside, some Samnites brought him a large gift of gold. But he rejected this, saying that it seemed to him less glorious to possess gold than to rule over those who have it.


Wrinkles and gray hair cannot suddenly demand respect. Only when the earlier years of life have been well spent does old age at last gather the fruits of admiration. 63. When that has finally happened, the signs of respect may at first seem unimportant or even trivial—morning visits, requests for meetings, people making way for you and rising when you approach, being escorted to and from the Forum, being asked for advice. We Romans scrupulously practice these civilities, as do all other decent nations.


A story goes that once in Athens an old man went to a crowded theater to see a play, but not one of his countrymen offered him a seat. However, when he came to the section reserved for visiting Spartan delegates, each of them rose and invited him to sit down.


It seems to me that those who make good use of such rewards are like actors who have played well to the end their role in the drama of life, and not like incompetent players who fall apart in the last act.


Young people are much more likely than the old to suffer death by accident. They also fall sick more easily, suffer more intently, and are harder to cure. That is why so few young people arrive at old age. If so many didn’t die young, we would have a wiser and more prudent population.


But to me nothing that has an end seems long. For when that end comes, all that came before is gone. All that remains then are the good and worthy deeds you have done in your life. Hours and days, months and years flow by, but the past returns no more and the future we cannot know. We should be content with whatever time we are given to live.


An actor does not need to remain on stage throughout a play. It is enough that he appears in the appropriate acts. Likewise, a wise man need not stay on the stage of this world until the audience applauds at the end. The time allotted to our lives may be short, but it is long enough to live honestly and decently.


And—to say a few boastful words about myself, as old men often will—do you think that I would have labored so hard day and night, at home and in wars abroad, if I believed that the end of this earthly life would mark the limit of my fame? If that were the case, surely I would have done much better to have led a quiet and peaceful life free from labor and strife.


## Seneca's Letters from a Stoic, Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Pocket  Classic


Let us rush past all this clever nonsense, and hurry on to that which will bring us real assistance. No man who is anxiously running after a midwife for his daughter in her birth-pangs will stop to read the praetor's edict or the order of events at the games. No one who is speeding to save his burning house will scan a checker-board to speculate how the imprisoned piece can be freed. 31. But good heavens!–In your case all sorts of news are announced on all sides–your house afire, your children in danger, your country in a state of siege, your property plundered. Add to this shipwreck, earthquakes, and all other objects of dread; harassed amid these troubles, are you taking time for matters which serve merely for mental entertainment? Do you ask what difference there is between wisdom and being wise? Do you tie and untie knots while such a ruin is hanging over your head? 32. Nature has not given us such a generous and free-handed space of time that we can have the leisure to waste any of it. Mark also how much is lost even when men are very careful: people are robbed of one thing by ill-health and of another thing by illness in the family; at one time private, at another public, business absorbs the attention; and all the while sleep shares our lives with us. Out of this time, so short and swift, that carries us away in its flight, of what avail is it to spend the greater part on useless things? 33. Besides, our minds are accustomed to entertain rather than to cure themselves, to make an aesthetic pleasure out of philosophy, when philosophy should really be a remedy. What the distinction is between wisdom and being wise I do not know; but I do know that it makes no difference to me whether I know such matters or am ignorant of them. Tell me: when I have found out the difference between wisdom and being wise, shall I be wise? Why then do you occupy me with the words rather than with the works of wisdom? Make me braver, make me calmer, make me the equal of Fortune, make me her superior. And I can be her superior, if I apply to this end everything that I learn. Farewell.


Cato's famous one, who says: "Borrow from yourself!" No matter how small it is, it will be enough if we can only make up the deficit from our own resources. For, my dear Lucilius, it does not matter whether you crave nothing, or whether you possess something. The important principle in either case is the same–freedom from worry.


Nature does not care whether the bread is the coarse kind or the finest wheat; she does not desire the stomach to be entertained, but to be filled.


Enough is never too little, and not-enough is never too much.


But that which is enough for nature, is not enough for man.


luxury which is not "happiness"; a luxury which seeks how it may prolong hunger even after repletion, how to stuff the stomach, not to fill it, and how to rouse a thirst that has been satisfied with the first drink.


it makes no difference to one's thirst in what costly goblet, or with what elaborate state, the water is served. For if you believe it to be of importance how curly-haired your slave is, or how transparent is the cup which he offers you, you are not thirsty.


Everything conducive to our well-being is prepared and ready to our hands; but what luxury requires can never be got together except with wretchedness and anxiety.


we regard nothing as good which can be put to wrong use by any person.


we have praised the deed but we have despised the man.


But we, to whom such corruptible bodies have been allotted, nevertheless set eternity before our eyes, and in our hopes grasp at the utmost space of time to which the life of man can be extended, satisfied with no income and with no influence. What can be more shameless or foolish than this? Nothing is enough for us, though we must die some day, or rather, are already dying; for we stand daily nearer the brink, and every hour of time thrusts us on towards the precipice over which we must fall. 18. See how blind our minds are! What I speak of as in the future is happening at this minute, and a large portion of it has already happened; for it consists of our past lives. But we are mistaken in fearing the last day, seeing that each day, as it passes, counts just as much to the credit of death. The failing step does not produce, it merely announces, weariness. The last hour reaches, but every hour approaches, death. Death wears us away, but does not whirl us away.


You ask me how this depravity comes upon the soul–this habit of reversing the daylight and giving over one's whole existence to the night? All vices rebel against Nature; they all abandon the appointed order. It is the motto of luxury to enjoy what is unusual, and not only to depart from that which is right, but to leave it as far behind as possible, and finally even take a stand in opposition thereto.


Do not men live contrary to Nature who endeavour to look fresh and boyish at an age unsuitable for such an attempt? What could be more cruel or more wretched? Cannot time and man's estate ever carry such a person beyond an artificial boyhood? 8. Do not men live contrary to Nature who crave roses in winter, or seek to raise a spring flower like the lily by means of hot-water heaters and artificial changes of temperature? Do not men live contrary to Nature who grow fruit-trees on the top of a wall? Or raise waving forests upon the roofs and battlements of their houses–the roots starting at a point to which it would be outlandish for the tree-tops to reach? Do not men live contrary to Nature who lay the foundations of bathrooms in the sea and do not imagine that they can enjoy their swim unless the heated pool is lashed as with the waves of a storm? 9. When men have begun to desire all things in opposition to the ways of Nature, they end by entirely abandoning the ways of Nature.


nothing is heavy if one accepts it with a light heart,


"Bad bread!" you say. But just wait for it; it will become good. Hunger will make even such bread delicate and of the finest flavour.


To have whatsoever he wishes is in no man's power; it is in his power not to wish for what he has not, but cheerfully to employ what comes to him.


For that which toil has accumulated, rest can lighten.


There are things which, if done by the few, we should refuse to imitate; yet when the majority have begun to do them, we follow along–just as if anything were more honourable because it is more frequent!


it is disgraceful for all your baggage to be made up of that which can be rattled along without danger.


you should close your ears against evil talk, and right at the outset, too; for when such talk has gained an entrance and the words are admitted and are in our minds, they become more shameless.


Do you not see how different is the method of descending a mountain from that employed in climbing upwards? Men coming down a slope bend backwards; men ascending a steep place lean forward. For, my dear Lucilius, to allow yourself to put your body's weight ahead when coming down, or, when climbing up, to throw it backward is to comply with vice. The pleasures take one down hill but one must work upwards toward that which is rough and hard to climb; in the one case let us throw our bodies forward, in the others let us put the check-rein on them.


But why is the Good non-existent in a tree or in a dumb beast? Because there is no reason there, either. For the same cause, then, the Good is non-existent in a child, for the child also has no reason; the child will reach the Good only when he reaches reason.


No man is vicious except one who has the capacity of virtue;


Why, pray, do you foster and practise your bodily strength? Nature has granted strength in greater degree to cattle and wild beasts. Why cultivate your beauty? After all your efforts, dumb animals surpass you in comeliness. Why dress your hair with such unending attention? Though you let it down in Parthian fashion, or tie it up in the German style, or, as the Scythians do, let it flow wild–yet you will see a mane of greater thickness tossing upon any horse you choose, and a mane of greater beauty bristling upon the neck of any lion. And even after training yourself for speed, you will be no match for the hare. 23. Are you not willing to abandon all these details–wherein you must acknowledge defeat, striving as you are for something that is not your own and come back to the Good that is really yours?


And what is this Good? It is a clear and flawless mind, which rivals that of God, raised far above mortal concerns, and counting nothing of its own to be outside itself. You are a reasoning animal. What Good, then, lies within you? Perfect reason. Are you willing to develop this to its farthest limits–to its greatest degree of increase? 24. Only consider yourself happy when all your joys are born of reason, and when–having marked all the objects which men clutch at, or pray for, or watch over–you find nothing which you will desire; mind, I do not say prefer. Here is a short rule by which to measure yourself, and by the test of which you may feel that you have reached perfection: "You will come to your own when you shall understand that those whom the world calls fortunate are really the most unfortunate of all." Farewell.
