With effortless focus, Munenori Sensei smoothly pulls the arrow to bend his bow. Released like a ripe fruit, the arrow glides. It races toward your heart. In the eternity of the arrow’s flight, you wonder: What is this present moment? Confronting its end, your mind becomes razor sharp, cleaving time into uncountable, quickly passing moments. At one such perfect instant you see the arrow as it floats, suspended between the finest ticks of the most precise clock. In this instant of no time, the arrow has no motion, and nothing pushes or pulls it toward your heart. How, then, does it move? While your beginner’s mind embraces the mystery, the arrow flies.


Newton and Leibniz, crucially, tackled the question of what happens when the time interval* Δt approaches zero—precisely the domain of Zeno’s paradox. What they were able to show is that, as you would expect, during this infinitesimal time interval, the distance interval Δd vanishes just like Δt does. Yet in a well-defined and mathematically precise way, the ratio Δd/Δt—the speed—nonetheless takes on a particular finite and nonzero value. This mathematical method, which forms the roots of differential calculus, gives a response to Zeno’s paradox. It says that you must not go all the way to the limit of zero duration without also going at the same time to the limit of zero distance interval—and if you do this correctly, the speed of the arrow never goes to zero. No matter how short the duration, the arrow is never at rest. There is no such thing as an instant of time during which the arrow does not move at all, so the premise of Zeno’s paradox, as well as the necessity of thinking about “atoms of time,” is neatly avoided.


How, at some instant of time, does the arrow “know” which way to go? At that instant, it has a position, but its velocity depends on where it was a moment ago. Does the arrow “remember” where it was? Or does it carry its velocity as some intrinsic property, like its color? Why does the arrow have inertia that keeps it going in the same direction as its velocity, yet changes in just the right way for the arrow to perfectly trace out a preordained path?


In a very real sense, we are speeding through the universe, right now, at about Mach 1,000—the sort of speed that could whisk someone to anywhere on Earth in less than a minute. Do you feel it?

How do objects know how to resist change in something so ephemeral? Does an object somehow “sense” all the other objects around it, so as to know how it is moving relative to them, and resist change to this motion? How does this make sense? What is this thing called inertia?


“So I’m drifting through the years. Moving in time. Steadily. But how do I feel that motion, when I could not feel the ship? If motion is meaningless, is the flow of time also empty?”


As Einstein is said to have joked: “When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it’s only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it’s two hours.”6 From this perspective, the phrase “moving through time” seems to make a bit more sense: time is laid out, like space, and as our internal sense of time ticks away, we experience both different places and different clock times. In this way, we move through space and time, both of which exist, all laid out, quite independent of us moving through them.


Time runs differently into the future and into the past.


The challenge that Zenjo whispers is a difficult one: Is time everything, or is it nothing?


(acceleration) = (gravitational field) × (gravitational charge) / (inertia). This tells us the acceleration of any object, given the gravitational field, along with two properties intrinsic to the object: its response to a gravitational field (gravitational charge) and its resistance to acceleration (inertia).


Galileo’s experiment and its successors show us that insofar as we can eliminate other nongravitational forces, all objects accelerate at precisely the same rate in a given gravitational field. For this to be true, gravitational charge and inertia must be the same thing! In other words, the extra difficulty in moving the iron ball is exactly, precisely, perfectly9 compensated by the extra force exerted on it by the Earth! This is not true of magnetism or any other force.

This is not true of magnetism or any other force. THIS AMAZING FACT sat essentially idle for 300 years, until Albert Einstein showed that there is a deep explanation for it, which requires a radically new way of thinking about space and time. Recall from the flight of THE ARROW that, absent any forces, objects move in a straight line, at a constant speed. Another way to say this is that in the absence of any forces, the path of an object is a straight line in space and time. To see this, let’s plot the balls’ trajectories just as we did for the arrow. As long as the ball rolls at a constant speed and direction, the path through space and time is straight. But if the ball speeds up—for example, because we have placed a magnet in front of it—it covers more and more distance through space for a given distance in time, and the path becomes curved; the wooden ball’s path, unaffected by the magnetic force, remains straight (see the figure below, top left panel). We could also imagine the balls being blown by a strong wind. In this case, all three experience the same force, but the wooden ball, having the least inertia, is affected the most; the lead ball is accelerated least (top right panel). For gravity, the Earth pulls on all three balls to accelerate them. The difference, as Galileo discovered, is that all three paths curve in exactly the same way (bottom panel).


The gravitational acceleration of an object has no connection whatsoever to what the object actually is; it depends only on the object’s environment. We might dismiss this as a strange curiosity. But to Einstein it was a crucial clue to the true nature of gravity. On the basis of this clue, Einstein declared that gravity is not a force at all.


mapmaking is telling us something crucial about the territory mapped: not just the locations of the objects, but the curvature of the substratum—the Earth—itself. The inability to map a surface with a single fixed scale onto a flat sheet tells us that the surface is curved. It took


So we understand how to take our journey one step at a time to get its true measure.


But imagine yourself in the thunderstorm that is happening somewhere on Earth at this moment. You notice that a flash of lightning and the accompanying thunder happen at different times by your internal clock. The interpretation is simple: the thunder is a sound wave traveling at the speed of sound and takes some time to reach you; the flash, traveling at the vastly faster speed of light, takes an imperceptible amount of time.


there is a complex relationship, and there can be an enormous difference, between what is happening right now and what we are observing right now. This does not feel terribly troubling, but it is a good reason to be very cautious.


Einstein’s formula using actual quantities, if your friend goes for a 10-minute walk (by her watch) while you stay in one place, then because she is moving while you are staying still, 10 minutes plus 3 femtoseconds will have passed for you when she returns.


Einstein’s formula using actual quantities, if your friend goes for a 10-minute walk (by her watch) while you stay in one place, then because she is moving while you are staying still, 10 minutes plus 3 femtoseconds will have passed for you when she returns. The effect is incredibly, undetectably tiny in real life as opposed to the gondola dream, because light travels at 300,000 kilometers (not 2 meters) per second. You could live thousands of years and never, ever notice it in your everyday life. But there it lurks: a fundamental difference between the way you think the world works, and the way it actually does. And make no mistake, it is real and well tested: for example, each satellite in the global positioning system (GPS) carries an extremely precise atomic clock. The rate of time passage on these satellites is verifiably different from the rate on Earth. In fact, this and other relativistic effects must be treated carefully in order for GPS to function at all; failure to account for them would lead to errors of tens of kilometers per day in your location!


The universal now is a fiction.


Lagrange formulated a beautiful set of equations that connect the Lagrangian (our L, not coincidentally) to the force felt by a particle traveling between two space-time events.


According to an observer watching from atop the cliff, the book appears to have a curved path, as do you. But the book travels in a straight line relative to you, who have jumped off with it. So who is right? Is it a straight line or not? This is quite reminiscent of the question of distance, or duration, between different events: each observer has a unique description, connected with that person’s own reference frame, and all are equally valid.


These paths have a particular property: just as a straight line in space is the shortest distance between two positions, the path that objects follow through space-time is the longest path between two events, if we measure the space-time length between the events by the “heartbeat time” experienced by someone following that path between the two events. Finally, forces can then be considered as any effects that cause objects to deviate from this natural path through space-time.


But as Einstein discovered, the fact that light travels at the same speed in any inertial frame requires Galileo’s rule to be modified into a different rule. This modified rule distorts space and time intervals, so that two events separated by some amount of time in one inertial frame are separated by a different amount of time in another frame.

But the transformation does not alter the heartbeat time (i.e., the space-time distance) between two events, so all frames agree on how much heartbeat time passes between them.
