Here’s a fairly simple kenning: “the swan of the beer of the dead,” which, when we first see it, we don’t now how to interpret. So, if we break it down, we see that “beer of the dead” means blood, and “swan of the blood” means the bird of death, the raven, so we see that “swan of the beer of the dead” simply means “raven.” And in Scandinavia, whole poems were written like this and with increasing complexity. But this did not happen in England. The metaphors remained in the first degree, without going any further.

But this did not happen in England. The metaphors remained in the first degree, without going any further. As for the use of alliteration, it is interesting to note that a verse is considered alliterative even if it contains stressed words beginning with different vowels. If a verse contains a word with the vowel a, another with , and another with i, they are alliterated. In fact, we cannot know exactly how the vowels were pronounced in Anglo-Saxon. Undoubtedly, Old English had a much more open sound and was more voiced than English is now. Now, in English, consonants serve as the high points of the syllables. On the contrary, Anglo-Saxon or Old English—these words are synonymous—was highly vocalic.9 Besides this, the Anglo-Saxon lexicon was completely Germanic. Before the Norman Conquest, the only other significant influence was the introduction of about five hundred words from Latin. These words were, for the most part, religious, or, if not religious, they named concepts that had not previously existed among those peoples.


In the Odyssey and the Iliad, we see that the bloody and bellicose events are the most paramount. The poet of Beowulf was interested in hospitality, manners, gift-giving, and minstrels more than in military feats; in other words, he was interested in what we would now call “social life.” All of these things were valued at that time and must have been quite appealing

The poet of Beowulf was interested in hospitality, manners, gift-giving, and minstrels more than in military feats; in other words, he was interested in what we would now call “social life.” All of these things were valued at that time and must have been quite appealing to the Saxons, who lived in a violent era and in inhospitable lands. Europe was colder then. We know this because research has shown that the animals who lived at that time in the south of Europe now live in the north.


Germanic custom. Ships containing the skeletons of men and animals have been found at the bottom of the sea.


in French as bague, meaning “ring.”


The word burh or burg is a word you know, and it means “castle” and has remained in the names of many cities: Edinburgh, “castle of Edin”; Strasbourg, Gothenburg—in the south of Sweden—and the Castilian city of Burgos, which is a Visigoth name. Then we have words like “bourgeois,” someone who lives in a city, and “bourgeoisie.”


The Vikings were perhaps the most extraordinary of all the Germanic peoples of the Middle Ages. They were the best sailors of their time. They had ships, which they called “longships,” that had a dragon, the head of a dragon, on the prow.


the day of the week “Thursday,” which in Saxon is thunresdæg, and contains the Norse name for Thor. But let’s return to the Vikings.


The Homeric Greeks said “the color of wine.” But we don’t know what color wine was for the Greeks; they don’t talk about colors, either. On the other hand, Celtic poetry that is contemporaneous or prior to Germanic poetry, contains an abundance of colors—it’s full of colors.


During the last decade of the tenth century, an event took place in England that had only relative military importance, but it had great relevance for the history of English literature, for out of it came the ballad of “The Battle of Maldon,” which tells of a defeat rather than a victory.


And Caedmon predicted the hour of his death, and he was so certain of it and his posthumous fate that just before this hour, he was asleep rather than in prayer.


Walt Whitman, who speaks about himself in his poems, saying: “Walt Whitman, un cosmos, hijo de Manhattan, turbulento, sensual, paternal, comiendo, bebiendo, sebrando.”


“elegy” really means a poem written to lament someone’s death. However, those poems are called “elegies” not because they lament a death but rather because of their melancholic tone.


England—so important in the history of the world—we see that it is a small island torn off the western- and northern-most reaches of Europe. What I mean is that if you showed a globe to a person who was ignorant of history, this person would never think that such a slip of an island torn by the sea—that slip of an island, penetrated by the sea on all sides—would become the

What I mean is that if you showed a globe to a person who was ignorant of history, this person would never think that such a slip of an island torn by the sea—that slip of an island, penetrated by the sea on all sides—would become the center of an empire. But that’s just what happened.


the sea symbolizes life with its storms and perils, and that an affinity with the sea means an affinity with life. We should not forget that people in the Middle Ages possessed the ability to read a poem on two different levels.

We should not forget that people in the Middle Ages possessed the ability to read a poem on two different levels. In other words, those who read this poem thought about the sea, about the seafarer, and they also thought that the sea could be an allegory or a symbol for life.


We must not assume, then, that we are necessarily more complex than the men of the Middle Ages, who were men well versed in theology and theological subtleties. We have surely gained a lot, but it is also possible that we have lost something.


I don’t think there were literary schools at that time. I think they wrote these verses because they felt them, and that they didn’t know they were doing something so extraordinary:


“Þæs ofereode, þisses swa mæg.” “That passed, so too shall this,”


Throughout the Middle Ages, the idea held sway that God had written two books. One of these books, needless to say, was sacred scripture—the Bible—dictated to various people at various times by the Holy Spirit. The other book was the Universe, and all its creatures. It was said repeatedly that the duty of every Christian was to study both books, the holy book and the other enigmatic book, the Universe.


Amazingly enough, the panther is a symbol of Christ.


it has only one enemy: the dragon. Thus, the dragon becomes the symbol of the devil.


masculine “moon” (“el luna”), masculine “salt” (“el sal”), masculine “star” (“el estrella”). Now, it is assumed that the masculine “moon” belongs to a very ancient era, an era of matriarchy, an era when women were more important than men. Women ruled over the family, and so the brighter light—the sun—was considered feminine, and in Norse mythology we have, analogously, a goddess of the sun and a god of the moon.


(In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche compares the sun to a tomcat walking on a carpet of stars. But he does not say “eine Katze,” which could also be a she-cat, but rather “ein Kater,” a tomcat, a male. And he thought of the moon as a monk, not a nun, who gazes enviously at Earth.)


Now, what was it that brought about this simplification, that made contemporary English a much simpler language, grammatically, though much richer in vocabulary than Old English? It is the fact that the Vikings, Danes, and Norwegians settled in the north and the center of England. Now, Old Norse was similar to English. The Saxons had to communicate with the Norsemen, who had become their neighbors, and very soon, the Saxons began to mingle with the Norsemen, who were fewer in number. The Norse race blended with the Saxon race. They had to understand each other, so in order to do so, and as the vocabulary was already so similar, a kind of lingua franca emerged, and English became simpler.


For example, we have “knife.” Why is there a k? Because in Old English this was pronounced, and it has remained like some sort of lost fossil.17 And then we also have the word “knight” in contemporary English. This seems absurd, but it is because in Anglo-Saxon the word cniht meant “servant” or “attendant.” That is, [the initial c] was pronounced.


Then we have two centuries, and during these two centuries it is as if English literature were taking place underground, because French was spoken in court, the clergy spoke Latin, and the people spoke Saxon (four Saxon dialects that were also intermingled with Danish). And one must wait from the year 1066 to the fourteenth century for English literature—which had carried on in a crude, clumsy way, which had continued on like an underground river—to reemerge. And then we have the great names of Chaucer, Langland, and then we have a language, English, that has been deeply permeated by French, to such an extent that, yes, indeed, currently there are more Latin than Germanic words in the English dictionary.


But the Germanic words are the essential ones, they are the words that correspond to fire, metals, man, trees. On the contrary, all the words of culture come from Latin. And here we conclude the


Only a few days have passed since last Friday, but for our studies, it is as if many more had gone by. We are going to leave the eleventh century, take a leap, and land straight in the eighteenth century.


Then they started making dictionaries. The first were Italian and French. In England, the first dictionary was written by an Italian, and called A Worlde of Wordes.6 Next came an etymological dictionary, which attempted


One day, one of his friends told him that the French Academy, with its forty members, had spent forty years creating a dictionary of the French language. And Johnson, who was a staunch nationalist, answered, “Forty Frenchmen to one Englishmen: the correct proportion.”


The poet should not deal with the individual but rather with the generic, for the poet is writing for posterity. He says that the poet must not concern himself with what is local, with what belongs to one class, one region, one nation. For since poetry has that lofty mission to be eternal, the poet should worry not about problems—Johnson did not use the word “problem,” for at that time that word was used specifically for mathematics—not about the concerns of his era, but rather should seek out the eternal, the eternal passions of man, as well as subjects such as the brevity of human life, the vicissitudes of destiny, the hopes we have for immortality, sins, virtues, etcetera.

And, according to one version of this legend—please forgive me this digression, but the story is beautiful—the prince, the driver, and the four characters he sees—the old man,


But in man there is some kind of infinite longing: once everything he can desire is satisfied, he will desire other things, and he doesn’t even know what they


But in man there is some kind of infinite longing: once everything he can desire is satisfied, he will desire other things, and he doesn’t even know what they are.


The philosopher answers that solitude has not allowed him to let go of the images of the city, its sins and its pleasures. That before, when he had all those pleasures within reach, he could gratify himself and then think about other things. But now, living in solitude, the only thing he does is think about the city and the pleasures he has renounced.


“Who wouldn’t take pity on the builders of the pyramids?” Then the prince says, “Who believes that power, luxury, and omnipotence can make a man happy? I will tell that man to look at these pyramids and admit his folly.”9


“Who wouldn’t take pity on the builders of the pyramids?” Then the prince says, “Who believes that power, luxury, and omnipotence can make a man happy? I will tell that man to look at these pyramids and admit his folly.”9 Then they visit a monastery,


The word “optimism” that we now use to mean “good humor” was a word invented to be used against Leibniz. He believed that we live in the best of all possible worlds,


Now, of course, this world is full of misfortune; I think having a toothache is enough to convince us that we don’t live in paradise.


Voltaire wrote Candide, he didn’t feel the world was so terrible. He was expounding a thesis and was having a lot of fun doing so. On the contrary, in Johnson’s Rasselas, we feel Johnson’s melancholy. We


he asked God forgiveness for how little he had tolerated, for all the foolish and crazy things he had done in his life. .


Macaulay says that the preeminence of Homer as an epic poet, of Shakespeare as a dramatic poet, of Demosthenes as an orator, and of Cervantes as a novelist is no less indisputable than the preeminence of Boswell as a biographer.


But he knew that everything would be tolerated because he was an important figure.


The Scot tends to be—perhaps as a result of all their theological discussions—much more intellectual, more rational. Englishmen are impulsive; they don’t need theories for their behavior. On the contrary, Scots tend to be thinkers and reasoners. Anyway, there are many differences.


There is a Hindu school of philosophy that says that we are not the actors in our lives, but rather the spectators, and this is illustrated using the metaphor of a dancer. These days, maybe it would be better to say an actor. A spectator sees a dancer or an actor, or, if you prefer, reads a novel, and ends up identifying with one of the characters who is there in front of him. This is what those Hindu thinkers


That is why people say Great Britain, to distinguish it from small Britain, or Brittany,


That is why people say Great Britain, to distinguish it from small Britain, or Brittany, in France. And in France they call that region of the country where the Breton language is spoken Bretagne; the language was thought to be like a patois for a long time, only because the French did not understand either language, so they assumed they were similar, which is part of a deep ideology.


I don’t know if I told you that long ago in Ireland, one had to study for ten years to have a literary career. One had to pass ten examinations. At first one could use only simple meters—let’s say, the hendecasyllable—and could write only about ten different subjects. Then, once these exams were finished—which were given orally in a dark room—they gave the subject and the meter the poet was supposed to use, and they brought him food. Two or three days later, they would question the poet, then allow him to use other subjects and other meters. After ten years, the poet reached the highest grade, but to get there, he had to have a complete knowledge of history, mythology, law, medicine—which was understood as magic in those days—and he received a pension from


I think it is Emerson who recounts that he paid him a visit and made an observation, and Wordsworth refuted him immediately—as was his habit, because no matter what anyone said, he would assert the opposite—and ten minutes or a quarter of an hour later, Wordsworth expressed that same opinion that he had found absurd.


Wordsworth brings to bear here his psychological theory of the origins of poetry. He says that poetry comes from emotion recollected in tranquility.


One of a writer’s most important works—perhaps the most important of all—is the image he leaves of himself in the memory of men, above and beyond the pages he has written.
