‘this marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’.


In themselves, these configurations of the mouth – p, f, b, v, t, d, k, g, sh, a, e and so on – amount to nothing more than a few haphazard spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to express, no power to explain. But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine, let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable ennui of existence (‘not tonight, Josephine’) to unravelling the fundamental order of the universe


Ancient languages such as Sanskrit, Greek and Gothic flaunted not just highly complex case systems on nouns, but even more complex systems of endings on verbs, which were used to express a range of intricate nuances of meaning. But once again, most of these structures did not survive the passing of time, and fell apart in the modern descendants. It seemed that the deeper linguists dug into history, the more impressive was the make-up of words they encountered, but when they followed the movement of languages through time, the only processes that could be discerned were disintegration and collapse.


the signs, then, seemed to point to some Golden Age lying somewhere in the twilight of prehistory ( just before records began), when languages were graced with perfectly formed structures, especially with elaborate arrays of endings on words. But at some subsequent stage, and for some unknown reason, the forces of destruction were unleashed on the languages and began battering the carefully crafted edifices, wearing away all those endings. So, strangely enough, what linguists were uncovering only seemed to confirm the gist of the biblical account: God gave Adam a perfect language some 6,000 years ago, and since then, we have just been messing it up.

One of the most original theories was surely that of Frenchman Jean-Pierre Brisset, who in 1900 demonstrated how human language (that is to say, French) developed directly from the croaking of frogs. One day, as Brisset was observing frogs in a pond, one of them looked him straight in the eye and croaked ‘coac’. After some deliberation, Brisset realized that what the frog was saying was simply an abbreviated version of the question ‘quoi que tu dis?’ He thus proceeded to derive the whole of language from permutations and combinations of ‘coac coac’.16


But rather than lamenting what can never be known, we can explore the part that does lie within reach.


the remarkable ability of children to acquire any human language. Take a human baby from any part of the globe, and plonk it anywhere on earth, say in Indonesian Borneo, and within only a few years it will grow up to speak fluent and flawless Indonesian.


In the early 1980s a pygmy chimpanzee (or bonobo) called Kanzi18 made history by becoming the first ape to learn to communicate with humans without formal training.


In the early 1980s a pygmy chimpanzee (or bonobo) called Kanzi18 made history by becoming the first ape to learn to communicate with humans without formal training. The baby Kanzi, born at the Language Research Center of the Georgia State University, Atlanta, used to play by his mother’s side during her training sessions, when researchers tried (rather unsuccessfully) to teach her to communicate by pointing at picture-symbols. The trainers ignored the baby because they thought he was still too young to learn, but unbeknownst to them, Kanzi was taking in more than his mother ever did, and as he grew up he went on to develop cognitive and communicative skills far surpassing any other ape before. As an adult, he is reported to be able to use over 200 different symbols, and to understand as many as 500 spoken words and even some very simple sentences.


a language with only words, and no structure to prop them up, would be a poor instrument of communication. Words may be the bricks in the language edifice, but when we want to convey subtle thoughts, involving intricate relations between different concepts, we need to combine words into proper sentences.


‘natural’ is very much a matter of geography: what is perfectly natural to a Turk does not seem even remotely natural to an English speaker.

fact, the multi-tier organization of the sentence is one of the most fundamental design-features of language. Even though on the surface a sentence might seem like just a string of words in linear succession, underneath the floorboards there is a lot going on, with words hierarchically organized on different tiers.


The quarrelsome seal that was eyeing a disenchanted but rather attractive fish that was jumping in and out of the icy water has picked a fight with a phlegmatic walrus that was innocently passing by. The fourth sentence, running to a total of thirty-five words, is pretty complex. And yet, for a speaker of English, this sentence is immediately comprehensible, because its complexity is mitigated by the hierarchy of command.


Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew. The architecture of the Semitic verb is one of the most imposing edifices to be seen anywhere in the world’s languages, but it is founded on a concept of the sparest design: a root which consists of only consonants.

The teacher claimed it was so plain, I only had to use my brain. She said the past of throw was threw, The past of grow – of course – was grew, So flew must be the past of fly, And now, my boy, your turn to try. But when I trew, I had no clue, If mow was mew Like know and knew (Or is it knowed Like snow and snowed?) The teacher frowned at me and said The past of feed was – plainly – fed. Fed up, I knew then what I ned: I took a break, and out I snoke, She shook and quook (or quaked? or quoke?) With raging anger out she broke: Your ignorance you want to hide? Tell me the past form of collide! But how on earth should I decide If it’s collid (Like hide and hid), Or else – from all that I surmose, The past of rise was simply rose, And that of ride was surely rode, So of collide must be collode? Oh damn these English verbs, I thought The whole thing absolutely stought! Of English I have had enough, These verbs of yours are far too tough. Bolt upright in my chair I sat, And said to her ‘that’s that’ – I quat.


A stone, for instance, may be an ‘it’ in English, but it is most definitely a ‘he’ in German, Norwegian, Polish, Albanian, Russian or Lithuanian, and unquestionably a ‘she’ in French, Italian, Irish or Hebrew. Classical Greek and Akkadian (the language of Ancient Babylon and Assyria) came up with something even better, since in these languages, a stone was a ‘he’ or ‘she’ depending on one’s fancy.


Well, the Polychronicon wasn’t really concerned with cutlery. At that time, ‘spoon’ just meant a thin piece of wood, a chip, or a splinter.


One only need compare a short phrase from the four biblical passages above to appreciate that no area of English stood still for very long: ∼ 1000: me ofthingth(displeases) sothlice(soothly) thæt(that) ic(I) hi(them) worhte(made) ∼ 1400: forsothe it othenkith(displeases) me to haue maad hem (them) ∼ 1600: for it repenteth me that I haue made them ∼ 2000: because I regret having made them


by the sixteenth century, ‘I’ came to be pronounced {ay}. And by the eighteenth century, {ay} changed further into the modern pronunciation {eye}.


I take it you already know6 Of tough and bough and cough and dough? Others may stumble, but not you, On hiccough, thorough, lough, and through? Well done! And now you wish perhaps, To learn of less familiar traps? Beware of heard, a dreadful word That looks like beard and sounds like bird. And dead – it’s said like bed, not bead – For goodness sake, don’t call it ‘deed’. Watch out for meat and great and threat (They rhyme with suite and straight and debt): A moth is not a moth in mother, Nor both in bother, broth in brother. And here is not a match for there Nor dear and fear for bear and pear. And then there’s dose and rose and lose – Just look them up – and goose and choose, And cork and work and card and ward, And font and front, and word and sword, And do and go, and thwart and cart – Come! Come! I’ve hardly made a start! (From the Manchester Guardian, 1954)


it is unfair to say that English spelling is not an accurate rendering of speech. It is – it’s only that it renders the speech of the sixteenth century.


For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.


The simple truth is that all languages change, all the time – the only static languages are dead ones.


Just imagine two groups living in two neighbouring villages, speaking similar varieties of one language. With the passing of time, their language undergoes constant transformations, but as long as the two communities remain in close contact, their varieties will change in tandem: innovations in one village will soon spread to the other, because of the need to communicate. Now suppose that one of the groups wanders off in search of better land, and loses all contact with the speakers of the other village. The language of the two groups will then start wandering in different directions, because there will be nothing to maintain the changes in tandem. Eventually, their varieties will have strayed so far apart that they will no longer be mutually intelligible, and so turn into different languages.


Even if some changes in language come about in order to adapt to changing realities, these constitute only a minor part of the overall transformations that languages undergo. The main bulk of changes must stem from entirely different reasons. There is a close runner-up in the list of ‘obvious’ explanations for why language changes so much, and that is the issue of contact.


It seems that languages need neither nudging from the Joneses nor the gadgetry of ploughs in order to be transformed, for they keep changing, even without the slightest provocation, and even in spite of people’s best intentions.


It seems that languages need neither nudging from the Joneses nor the gadgetry of ploughs in order to be transformed, for they keep changing, even without the slightest provocation, and even in spite of people’s best intentions. But if all these external reasons fail to explain the changes, then there must be something in language itself which makes it so unsteady. There must be something inherently unstable in the very way in which we communicate, some element of volatility which drives language into a state of inner restlessness, and gives it itchy feet. But what? The


Changes in language come about in a rather similar fashion, through the accumulation of unintended actions. These actions must stem from entirely selfish motives, not from


the motives for change can be encapsulated in the triad economy, expressiveness and analogy.


the motives for change can be encapsulated in the triad economy, expressiveness and analogy. Economy refers to the tendency to save effort, and is behind the short-cuts speakers often take in pronunciation. As we shall see in the following chapter, when these short-cuts accumulate, they can create new sounds, just like the new footpath cutting through the field. Expressiveness relates to speakers’ attempts to achieve greater effect for their utterances and extend their range of meaning.


analogy, is shorthand for the mind’s craving for order, the instinctive need of speakers to find regularity in language.


the verb ‘resent’ simply had a different meaning, and could do the work of our modern ‘appreciate’ or ‘feel grateful for’ – exactly the opposite of its sense today.


‘fast’, which started off meaning something like ‘secure’, or ‘not moving at all’, later developed the contrary sense ‘moving quickly’.


Shakespeare may have used ‘like’ in the older sense (‘the musician likes me not’), but in fact, he also uses ‘like’ in the modern – flipped – meaning. In Othello, for instance, the musicians are told: ‘the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.’


as the seventeenth century drew to a close, the positive sense of ‘resent’ gradually faded away. While speakers at the time would hardly have noticed it, nearly four centuries on this creates the appearance of a complete U-turn.


‘The decay of the French language,’ he declared, ‘started in 1789,’ to which Hugo famously retorted: ‘À quelle heure, s’il vous plaît?’


The forces of destruction almost seem to leap out of the pages of practically any language’s history, but the contrary processes, the productive forces of renewal and creation, are much more difficult to spot


Just and jurisdiction, for instance, both go back to the Latin root jus ‘justice’, but in justus ‘just’, the s remained unaltered, whereas in jurisdictio ‘administration of justice’, the s of the genitive case jusis was caught between two vowels, so it changed to juris. The same applies to rustic and rural, both from the noun rus ‘country’.)


Italian caldo means not ‘cold’ but ‘hot’?


The changes at the top (g → k, d → t, b → p) also represent a kind of weakening, but here effort is spared for the vocal cords. The sounds g, d and b are called ‘voiced’ consonants, because when we produce them, the vocal cords start vibrating at the same time as the air is released from its temporary blockage, or just a split second before. The sounds k, t and p are called ‘voiceless’ consonants, because they are produced without the additional vibration of the vocal cords, but with the tongue or lips blocking the air in exactly the same way as in g, d and b. (You can check out the difference by pronouncing each of the pairs while whispering. You will hear that the distinction between the voiced and voiceless sounds almost disappears.) Of course, vibrating the vocal cords is an additional effort that can sometimes be spared, and so a voiced g turned into a voiceless k, and similarly, d turned to t, and b to p.


Grimm’s law explains why the relation between English words and their cognates in non-Germanic Indo-European languages is not always immediately apparent to the untrained eye. English cold, for instance, is related to Italian gelato ‘frozen’ rather than to its false friend caldo ‘hot’. And there are many other such surprising ‘twins’, cognates such as grain and corn, which may look rather different to the casual observer, but nevertheless come via different routes from exactly the same Proto-Indo-European root.


Old English hlaf-weard ‘loaf-ward(en)’ or ‘bread keeper’. Hlaf-weard, with its two words and three syllables, was shortened to hlaford, thence to laferd, then lowerd, until it finally ended up as our impoverished modern lord, with just one halfpenny-syllable to his name.


persica malus ‘Persian apple’, with its five juicy vowels and seven luscious consonants. It ended up in French as a word of just one vowel and two consonants: first, the whole second word was dropped altogether, leaving persica. Then the vowel i disappeared to give persca, which was further shortened to pesca, then to pesche, and finally pêche, ending up on English palates as a rather shrivelled ‘peach’. In fact, when it comes to shedding syllables, French is a prime example.


The prehistoric ancestor, Proto-Indo-European, had eight distinct cases, but only Sanskrit retained the full system, whereas in all the other daughter languages, erosion had started taking its toll even before the earliest records began.


The verb ‘make’ is one example, since its irregular past tense ‘made’ is only a fairly recent mishap. In the thirteenth century, ‘make’ was still a well-behaved regular verb, and had a past tense with the ending -ed. But clearly, the form ‘maked’ felt too broad in the beam, and so speakers stopped bothering with pronouncing the bit in the middle.


Alas, it seems that meaning is just as prone to attrition as sounds. And ironically, the decay in meaning seems to be set off not by any indolent desire to save effort, but rather by almost the precise opposite: the wish to enhance expressiveness.


‘Not’ is thus a prime example of both material and social decline. It started as a paunchy ne-a-wiht ‘nothing whatsoever’, a word rich in length and weighty in meaning, but its form was reduced to not (or even just n’t), and its meaning eroded to the plainest of no’s.


The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs, and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong, indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.


most European languages (except a handful like Basque, Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian) were related to one another, and even to some languages of India and Persia, through one common prehistoric ancestor


Many people know that the existence and location of Neptune were hypothesized by the mathematician John Couch Adams in 1843, on the basis of peculiarities in the movement of another planet, Uranus. Following his predictions of where this planet should be found, astronomers eventually managed to spot the elusive Neptune in the sky. Fewer people know of an equally extraordinary coup in the study of language, made three decades later by a Swiss whizz-kid called Ferdinand de Saussure,31 probably the cleverest of linguists before or since.


At the implausible age of twenty-one,


Hittite was so much older than the other attested Indo-European languages (some of its texts dated from the seventeenth century BC) that it still contained a certain consonant, transcribed as , which – lo and behold – appeared in the very places where Saussure had expected one of the rogue sounds to turn up. Take the root ‘protect’, for instance, which appeared as pās in the other languages, but which according to Saussure must earlier have been paXs (and ultimately have started out as a regular peXs). In the Hittite texts, this root showed up with an additional consonant precisely where Saussure expected an X – it was written pas. What Saussure had deduced purely on the basis of formal correspondences between the other Indo-European languages was dug up more than thirty years later from the Anatolian earth, scratched on clay.


In prehistoric times, according to Schleicher, a nation was busy constructing its language, and ‘only when a nation has perfected its language, may it make its entrance into history’. But upon entering the stage of history a radical change of direction has to take place, since from now on the energy of a people is invested in history-making instead. So once history, ‘that enemy of language’, gets under

But upon entering the stage of history a radical change of direction has to take place, since from now on the energy of a people is invested in history-making instead. So once history, ‘that enemy of language’, gets under way, language begins to fall apart and decay.


Yeats’s closing lines from his poem ‘He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven’: ‘I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.’


meta-phora is Greek for ‘carry across’ (meta = ‘across’, phor = ‘carry’). Or to use the Latin equivalent, meta-phor just means trans-fer.


In India there is a sect of Jainist monks called the Shvetambara, who always carry a broom and sweep the ground before them as they walk, lest they accidentally tread on some insects and squash them. If one were to show the same consideration towards metaphors in language, one would require much more than a broom. One would need to levitate, or take a vow of eternal silence, for it transpires that even the most tedious prose is teeming with metaphors.


The word ‘thrill’, for example, goes back to an Old English verb thyrlian, which originally meant ‘pierce’ (and incidentally, is related to the word nos-thyrl, ‘nostril’, or ‘nose-hole’).


‘Rival’ comes from Latin rivalis, meaning someone who shares the same river. From there, the word came to mean someone who shares (or competes for) the same mistress (that is, rival in love), and from there, to rival more generally.


‘Sarcastic’ comes from Greek ‘flesh tearing’ (sárx – flesh), and is related to the word sarcophagus (literally ‘flesh eating’).


Today ‘abstract’ may be the fare of philosophers, a word used to refer to concepts that are removed from physical reality. But the origins of ‘abstract’ are much more earthly, as ‘abstract’ comes from a Latin verb which simply meant ‘draw away’ (abstrahere).


The verb ‘understand’ itself may be a brittle old skeleton by now, but its origin is still obvious: under-stand originally must have meant something like ‘step under’, perhaps rather like the image in the phrase ‘get to the bottom of’.


‘Have’ ultimately derives from a Proto-Indo-European root *kap, which meant ‘seize’. The original sense of *kap survives in the Latin root cap ‘seize’, which found its way into English in the borrowed words ‘capture’ (as well as in ‘captive’, ‘caption’, ‘capable’, ‘recipe’, ‘occupy’, and even ‘catch’). The reason why the English home-grown ‘have’ looks so different from its forebear *kap is simply Grimm’s law, the series of sound changes in Germanic mentioned in the previous chapter, in which k was weakened to h, and p to f, thus turning *kap into *haf. So while ‘capture’ and ‘have’ look rather un-identical, they are in fact a pair of separated twins, deriving from the same source, *kap ‘seize’.


Consider some of the simplest words we use to describe spatial relations: prepositions such as in, at, by, from, to, behind, within, through. The examples below should suffice to show that all these spatial terms function just as well in the domain of temporal relations: The list could easily be lengthened, and the correspondences are by no means coincidental. What’s more, if the same experiment were to be repeated with spatial concepts in any other language, the result would be the same, as there is no known language where spatial terms are not also used to describe temporal relations. Language thus demonstrates that long before physicists, common intuition had already spotted the relation between space and time, and the nature of this intuited link is none other than metaphor.

One good example is ‘pointing words’ (or ‘demonstratives’ in linguistic terminology) such as the English ‘that’, which are used to point at an object and single it out.

Bakunin is spot on: the forces that create grammatical structures in language are nothing other than the by-products of destruction.


we call some words ‘content words’ because they have an independent meaning, and we call other words ‘grammatical words’ because they don’t.


Here is a slightly absurd example, which might help to drive the point home.


but originally ‘will’ was an entirely normal verb that simply meant ‘want to’ or ‘desire’.

There’s only so much you can do with a single word. You can spit it out with passion and intone it with gravity, but there’s a limit to the amount of emphasis you can invest in it this way. So what do you do if you want to add more weight? You add more words. You combine them, pile them up into longer phrases.


Old English ufan meant ‘on up’ – it was the locative case of the preposition uf ‘up’. But this little ufan was not considered nearly sturdy enough, so it was reinforced by another preposition, be ‘by’, to give a beefier be-ufan ‘by on up’. But before long, be-ufan was assaulted by the forces of erosion, and ended up as a mere bufan. Naturally, the syllabically-challenged bufan had to be pumped up again, this time by the preposition an ‘on’, to give an-bufan ‘on by on up’. Later on, anbufan was ground down by erosion, and – to cut a long story short – ended up as the modest above. But it seems that a mere above doesn’t soar nearly high enough nowadays, so we sometimes feel the need to reinforce it with ‘up’, to give up above – literally ‘up on by on up’.


What makes the Semitic verbal architecture so special is not so much the sheer bulk of the templates, but rather the remarkable idea behind their design, the system of tri-consonantal roots and prefabricated vowel templates.

For if it was not invented, how could people ever have stumbled across such an unusual idea?

For if it was not invented, how could people ever have stumbled across such an unusual idea? And yet, there is an alternative explanation. We do not have to call on a deus ex machina to account for the origin of designs such as the Semitic verbal system, nor is there any need to discern the guiding hand of an architect in their construction. The following pages will try to show that it is within our grasp to understand how abstract linguistic designs could have arisen of their own accord. But if there is to be any chance of success in this enterprise, then we cannot pin all our hopes on erosion alone. We have to call on another essential element, one which the previous chapters have rather neglected. Chapter 2 mentioned a triad of motives for language’s inner restlessness: economy, expressiveness and analogy. So far, however, only the first two of these motives have received much attention: economy, which causes the erosion in sounds, and expressiveness, which results in the inflationary erosion in meaning and drives the flow of metaphors from the concrete to the abstract. The role of analogy was acknowledged only summarily (in Chapter 4), as the cognitive mechanism behind our ability to find similarities between different domains, that is, our capacity for metaphorical thinking. Nevertheless, to understand how abstract designs can emerge in language, what will prove critical is exactly this overlooked third part of the triad, analogy, or the mind’s craving for order. This


‘Funes the Memorious’, the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges tells of a man called Funes, who lost consciousness when he was thrown off a horse and after regaining it found that he couldn’t forget anything he had ever seen or heard.


To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract.


Borges understood that the ability to pick out patterns, to draw analogies between unequal yet similar things, in short, to ‘forget a difference’, is at the very core of our intelligence.


‘Cherry’ comes from Old Northern French cherise, a word which happened to end with an s sound although it wasn’t plural – just like ‘cheese’ today. In the fourteenth century, some speakers falsely assumed that cherise was an instance of the common pattern NOUN+s → PLURAL, so they applied this pattern in reverse, and produced the singular form ‘cherry’. This must initially have sounded just as ‘wrong’ to educated speakers as ‘one chee’ would to us today.


The oldest known member of the language family is Akkadian, which is attested from around 2500 BC, and is thus one of the earliest written languages of all. (Only Sumerian and Ancient Egyptian can beat that record.) Akkadian


after 2000 BC, Akkadian diverged into two main varieties, Babylonian in the south of Mesopotamia and Assyrian in the north, both of which were to become the languages of powerful empires. Speakers of Akkadian (both Babylonian and Assyrian) dominated the political and cultural horizon of the Near East up until the sixth century BC.


More stable than the power of the sword, however, was the cultural hegemony of Mesopotamia over the whole region.

This short missive was written in the twenty-third century BC, and shows that on some issues, little has changed in more than 4,000 years: A letter from the Old Akkadian period, twenty-third century BC The other languages of the Semitic family are attested from a much later period. The next in line is the Canaanite branch of Semitic, which includes Hebrew and other closely related varieties such as Phoenician, Moabite and Ammonite. Some time in the second millennium BC, the Canaanites developed the first ever writing system for the common man, the alphabet. (Which group among them was the first to do so is still a moot point.) Hebrew was spoken by the Judeans and Israelites until the last few centuries BC, when it was displaced by Aramaic, but it survived as the religious and literary language of the Jews, and was revived in the twentieth century as the language of modern Israel. Phoenician was the language of the seafaring people of the Lebanese coastal cities Tyre, Sidon and Byblos. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Phoenicians is responsible, among other things, for the exportation of the Canaanite alphabet to the Greeks, and for the word ‘Bible’. (The Greeks called papyrus-paper ‘Byblos’, because that was the city from which they imported this commodity. The word then assumed the sense of ‘book’, and thence ‘The Book’.) The Phoenicians also founded various trading colonies in Europe and North Africa, one of which was Carthage (Kart-hadasht or ‘Newtown’ in the Punic dialect of Phoenician). Another sibling in the Semitic family, Aramaic, has its roots in today’s Syria. During the first millennium BC, Aramaic speakers spread across a much wider area, so that Aramaic eventually became the street-lingo in Palestine and even in Assyria and Babylon. In the sixth century BC, after the fall of Babylon, Aramaic even became the official language of the Achaemenid (Persian) empire. Some parts of the Old Testament, such as the Book of Daniel, are written mostly in Aramaic, and a later dialect, Syriac, became the vehicle of important Christian literature and exegesis. Varieties

Phoenician was the language of the seafaring people of the Lebanese coastal cities Tyre, Sidon and Byblos. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Phoenicians is responsible, among other things, for the exportation of the Canaanite alphabet to the Greeks, and for the word ‘Bible’. (The Greeks called papyrus-paper ‘Byblos’, because that was the city from which they imported this commodity. The word then assumed the sense of ‘book’, and thence ‘The Book’.)


Arabic has weakened the original Semitic p’s into f’s, following a well-trodden path which has also been traversed by the Germanic languages (Grimm’s law from Chapter 3). This is why the equivalent to the Akkadian root p-t-l appears in Arabic as f-t-l. What makes Arabic somewhat unusual, however, is the thoroughness of the change. Absolutely all the p’s in the language were weakened to f’s – no p was left unturned – so that Arabic is one of the few languages in the world which lacks the sound p altogether.


Unfortunately, no one has any idea (or more accurately, too many people have too many ideas) about


There is a story of an Englishman sitting in a restaurant in northern France, struggling with some of the finer points of the menu. The attentive waiter spots his difficulty, and asks politely: ‘Monsieur est étranger?’7 The Englishman looks shocked, and replies, with some dignity: ‘Étranger? Mais non, je suis Anglais!’


‘Red’, for instance, sometimes comes from ‘blood’, as in the Semitic languages, where dam ‘blood’ is the source of adam ‘red’ (and hence, incidentally, via the Hebrew word for ‘red dust’, the name of Adam,17 ‘man’).


during his state visit to Moscow,27 Fidel Castro is shown around the capital by Leonid Brezhnev. First of all, Castro is invited for a beer, which he downs in one go, and praises heartily. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘it was provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ Then Castro is chauffeured around the city, and is rather taken by the limo. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘these cars are provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ Later on, they visit an exhibition of fine crystal, and Castro duly waxes lyrical. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘the crystal is provided by our good friends from Czechoslovakia.’ ‘They must be very good friends,’ says Castro. ‘Yes,’ says Brezhnev, ‘they must.’


In linguistic jargon, however, ‘gender’ has nothing to do with sex, and can refer to any kind of classification that a language imposes on nouns.


They are in fact representatives of two vast opposing camps, into which the world’s languages seem to be divided roughly half and half. Arabic, Thai and Mixtec (an American-Indian language spoken in Mexico), just to take a handful of examples, arrange their elements more or less like English, whereas Japanese, Greenlandic Inuktitut (spoken by the 40,000 Inuit in Greenland) and Kannada (a Dravidian language spoken by 40 million people in southern India) arrange the elements roughly as in Turkish. This means that English tongues and minds can easily get into a terrible twist when trying to learn Turkish, but the Japanese, who have a reputation for struggling with English, often astound teachers of Turkish by the ease and speed with which they learn that language, even though there is no family relation between Turkish and Japanese whatsoever – Turkish and Japanese are as far removed from each other as either of them is from English.


Among the languages of the world which have gender distinctions, there seem to be only a few which have a consistent or nearly consistent logical classification. Tamil is an example of an almost entirely consistent system,


Semitic is family with longest history: the only serious contestant to the length of attested history is ancient Egyptian, whose written records start around 3000 BC, and whose later descendant, Coptic, was spoken until around AD 1500.
