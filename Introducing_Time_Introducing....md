The cicada is a remarkable chirping insect that remains underground for 17 years. Then 17 years after going underground, thousands of them emerge at the same time, climb the trees, mate and then die a few hours later, whereupon the 17-year cycle begins again.


The NIST F-1 (with a similar clock in Paris) is the most accurate clock in the world today. With a pool of atomic clocks around the globe, it is used to help define Coordinated Universal Time, which in turn helps define the speed of light, the length of the standard metre, and so on. But even this incredibly accurate clock will “lose” nearly a full second every 20 million years. Nothing is perfect!
