a Frenchman named Lavoisier decided that the sort of air that produced water when it was burnt should be called the water-producer. Being a scientist, he of course dressed this up in Greek, and the Greek for water producer is hydro-gen. The bit of air that made things acidic he decided to call the acid-maker or oxy-gen, and the one that produced nitre then got called nitro-gen. (Argon, the other major gas in air, wasn’t known about at the time, because it’s an inert gas and doesn’t produce anything at all.

This is because the Latin for witness was testis. From that one root, testis, English has inherited protest (bear witness for), detest (bear witness against), contest (bear witness competitively), and testicle. What are testicles doing there? They are testifying to a man’s virility. Do you want to prove that you’re a real man? Well, your testicles will testify in your favour.


Pan is one of those elements that gets everywhere. It’s panpresent. For example, when a film camera pans across from one face to another, that pan comes from the same Greek word that you’ll find in your underpants.


the word dream comes from the Anglo-Saxon for happiness. There’s a moral in that. It has always rained, happiness has always been a dream, and people have always been lazy.


word anon (not the shortening for anonymous, but the synonym for soon).


ancient Greeks went to war they always dipped their arrowheads in poison. The two ideas were so connected in the Greek mind that toxon became toxin.


point blank. The blank here is not your usual English blank, though it’s closely related. The blank in point blank is the French blanc, which of course means white.


The funny thing about archery is that you don’t usually aim at the target. Gravity decrees that if you aim straight at the blank your arrow will hit somewhere below. So you point the arrow somewhere above the blank, and hope that this cancels out the effects of Newton’s troublesome invention. That’s why aim high is another archer’s term; it doesn’t mean that you’ll end up high, or it’s not meant to. You aim high and hit on the level.

However, there’s one situation in which this rule does not apply: if you are very, very, very, very close to the target. In that case you can aim straight at the blank point or white spot in the middle. If you’re that close to the target, you’re at point blank range.
