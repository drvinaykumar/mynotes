The word ‘economics’ might sound a bit dry, and make you think of a load of boring statistics. But all it’s really about is how to help people to survive and to be healthy and educated. It’s about how people get what they need to live full, happy lives–and why some people don’t. If we can solve basic economic questions, maybe we can help everyone to live better lives.

The British economist Lionel Robbins once defined economics as the study of scarcity. Rare things like diamonds and white peacocks are scarce, but to economists pens and books are scarce too, even though you can easily find them at home or in your local shop. By scarcity they mean that there’s a limited amount, and people’s desires are potentially unlimited.

Economics, then, is about how we use scarce resources to satisfy needs. But it’s more than this. How do the choices facing people change? Those in poor societies face stark ones: a meal for the children or antibiotics for a sick grandmother. In rich countries like America or Sweden they rarely do. They might have to choose between a new watch and the latest iPad.

Most consumers are also workers because they earn money from a job. Firms, workers and consumers are the key elements of an economy. But banks and stock markets–the ‘financial system’–also influence how resources are used. Banks lend money to firms–they ‘finance’ them. When one lends money to a clothes manufacturer to build a new factory, the loan allows the manufacturer to buy cement, which ends up as part of the factory rather than in a new bridge. To raise money, companies sometimes sell ‘shares’ (or ‘stock’) in the stock market. When you own a share in Toshiba you own a tiny bit of the company and if Toshiba does well the price of its shares rise and you get richer.

It’s said that one night he dreamt of a swan spreading its wings and flying away while hooting loudly. The next day he met Plato, the man who would become his star pupil. Socrates saw in Plato the swan of his dream. The pupil became a teacher of humanity, his thought soaring high and wide for centuries to come.

Plato feared that if wealth became too important people would start to compete for it. Eventually the state would be ruled by the rich who’d be envied by the poor.

Making money out of money by lending it to someone for a price (for an ‘interest rate’) is the most unnatural economic activity possible; as we’ll see in the next chapter, Aristotle’s attack on moneylending influenced economic thinking for centuries to come. To Aristotle, then, it was clear that virtue lay with the honest farmers, not the clever bankers. As Plato and Aristotle

At the beginning of the eleventh century the pope said that merchants could never enter heaven. At the end of the following century the pope made a merchant called Homobonus a saint. The idea that to be close to God you had to be poor started to die out. Jesus told his disciples that they couldn’t serve both God and money, but by the time of Aquinas the merchants believed that they could. In 1253 an Italian firm began its handwritten accounts with the words ‘In the name of God and of profit’. God’s economy was merging with the new world of commerce.

Today we measure how rich a nation is in terms of the amount of food, clothes and other goods that its businesses produce. We no longer pay for things using gold. Instead we use ‘paper money’: pound notes and dollar bills which in themselves are worthless. Our coins, too, are made out of cheap metals worth much less than the actual value of the coins.

As explorers and armies conquered new lands, rulers gave merchants the right to trade with the territories. Sea voyages were risky, so a single person wouldn’t want to finance them alone. Rulers allowed the merchants to set up special companies in which a group of investors each contributed money and each received a share of the profits. The companies led the push into the foreign lands, earning wealth and fame for themselves and their rulers. The English East India Company, founded in 1600, of which Mun was an official, was one of them. The company turned into a powerful organisation and helped England to establish an empire in India.

For example, instead of trying to make as much money as possible, bakers would ensure that their neighbours had enough bread for their dinner. Butchers would take on new assistants not because they really needed them, but because their friends needed jobs. Everyone would be nice to each other and society would be a place of harmony. Smith turned this upside down. He argued that society does well when people act in their own self-interest. Instead of trying to be nice all the time, do what’s best for you and in the end more people will benefit. ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest,’ he said.

The production of a labourer’s cheap shirt depends on the efforts of many people and machines doing specialised tasks: wool spinners to make the thread, weavers to create the cloth and tailors to sew on the buttons. Then think of the people who chopped the wood to make the loom on which the fabric was woven and the miners who dug the iron to make the nails of the ship on which the finished shirt was transported. The work of thousands went into the shirt. Together their actions form a vast social mechanism, each piece moving with the others like those of a clock to deliver the shirt onto the body of the labourer exactly when he wants it. Smith

To Smith, the wealth of a nation was the entire amount of useful goods–wheat, beer, shirts, books–that a country’s economy produces for the people. This is how today’s economists think of it. A nation’s income (its ‘national income’) is the total value of all the goods that a country’s businesses make.

Ricardo therefore concluded that ‘the interest of the landlord is always opposed to the interest of every other class in the community’. The power of the landlords dragged down the economy, Ricardo said. When capitalists build factories and hire workers to make and grow things, they increase production in the economy. But with lower profits the capitalists have less to spend and so wealth creation slows down. Landowners get rich simply by collecting rent on the land. Instead of investing their income like the capitalists, they consume it on maids and butlers, on libraries for their mansions,

‘marginal utility’. Imagine eating a toffee. You love it. It gives you a lot of satisfaction, or ‘utility’, as economists call it. But as you eat more toffees the pleasure you get from an extra one won’t be as great. The tenth toffee is nice, but not as nice as the first. After eating fifteen toffees you start to tire of them. Perhaps the twentieth toffee gives you no pleasure at all. The pleasure from an extra toffee is its marginal utility. ‘Margin’ means the edge of something, so the ‘edge’ of your utility from toffees is the utility of the very last one you ate. The tendency of marginal utility to go down as you consume more is known as the ‘principle of diminishing marginal utility’.

The demand curve slopes downwards: as the price decreases people want more. A ‘supply curve’ links price with the quantity that firms produce. The supply curve slopes upwards: as the price rises firms become willing to make more spoons because the higher price covers the increased cost of production.

List’s proposal was to shield new industries from foreign competition. One way is to put a tax or ‘tariff’ on foreign goods. A German tariff on British steel makes British steel costlier for Germans. If the tariff is high enough then it makes British steel more expensive than German steel. People would then buy German steel and so Germany’s infant steel industry would survive. Economists call this policy ‘protection’.

‘welfare economics’. It examines the overall benefit to society that comes from all the decisions made, those that people make about buying, selling and working, and that firms make about production and employment. This is part of ‘normative economics’, the branch of economics that allows you to judge an economic situation, here whether a market is performing well or badly.

In Keynes’s theory, the income of a country isn’t what the economy is able to produce. How can it be, when so many factories and workers lie idle that the economy is producing much less than it’s able to? Instead, income is the amount that people spend, what they ‘demand’. When I buy your hats, I give you an income. When we all spend less, fewer goods are bought and fewer get made. The nation’s income is therefore lower. From this starting point, Keynes created a new explanation of recessions and unemployment.

When investors stop investing they stop borrowing people’s savings as loans. That means there’s a large supply of savings available for loan but little demand for them. When the supply of anything is bigger than what people demand, then its price falls. In this case, the price of the loan, the interest rate, falls. The lower interest rate encourages investors to borrow the savings to spend on new machines and factories. The result is that excess savings–the water backed up in the hose–always gets turned into a new flow of investment. Again the water level stays where it is.

recessions happen when more flows out of the bath than flows in. What happens is that businesspeople start to feel gloomy about the future and stop investing. That means that the amount of spending flowing into the economy as investment is less than that flowing out as savings.

recessions are caused by people saving rather than spending–what we often say is the sensible thing to do. The problem, then, is people being a bit too sensible! ‘Whenever you save five shillings, you put a man out of work for a day,’ said Keynes.

The new goods revolutionise whole industries and the economy expands. Eventually, some businesses fail and the economy starts to contract until a new round of innovation begins. Boom and bust, the up-and-down cycles of the capitalist economy, come from successive waves of innovation, the ebb and flow of entrepreneurship and imitation. New

Schumpeter thought that monopolies helped the economy to advance. Economists usually view monopolies as inefficient because they charge too much and produce too little. They recognise a few exceptions, though. In some industries huge investments need to be made to begin producing a good. A water supplier has to lay a network of pipes before it can supply any water, for example. A single firm supplying the whole market can spread the costs of the pipes over a large output and so supply water at a low cost. It would be much more expensive for ten firms to each lay their own network of pipes to supply a tenth of the market. Schumpeter believed that monopolies were especially important for bringing about innovation because they give entrepreneurs big rewards for the risky activity of trying to create new things.

Game theorists call it ‘strategic interaction’: we affect each other (we ‘interact’) and so we decide what to do in the light of what our enemy does (we’re ‘strategic’). Game theory is the study of strategic interactions that are found everywhere, from simple games like rock-paper-scissors to the search for profit by businesses and the wars fought between nations.

In fact Nash’s idea became the most important in game theory, still used all the time today. He said that the outcome of a game–its ‘equilibrium’–is that in which each player does the best for himself given what the other player does. When everyone’s doing that, no one has any reason to change what they’re doing, so that’s the equilibrium of the game. Nash proved that most games have an equilibrium–what became known as a ‘Nash equilibrium’. Take me and my enemy. Given that my enemy buys missiles, then my best response is to do the same: the worst thing would be to be unarmed in the face of enemy threats. The same reasoning applies to my enemy:

The doomsday machine illustrates a basic lesson of game theory: influencing what your opponent thinks about you is critical. A firm threatening to retaliate against a rival needs to show that it’s tough rather than weak. An economic equivalent of installing a doomsday machine is to build a much bigger factory than the market needs. Once built, it’s worth retaliating against competitors by flooding the market, even at rock-bottom prices, to get back some of the money spent building.

The problem is that to be profitable, a factory depends on there being other factories. To make money, a new sardine-canning factory needs to sell its sardines. Who’ll buy them? People in the traditional part of the economy earn very little and don’t have the money to buy tinned sardines. The factory’s own workers will spend some, not all, of their wages on them; they’ll want to buy shoes as well. If at the same time a shoe factory opened, then its workers would buy some sardines and the sardine factory’s workers would buy shoes. Each creates a market for the other’s products. For industrialisation to happen, then, workers need to be taken from the land and put into many different industries at the same time. Together the factories would be profitable, but on their own they wouldn’t be, so if you were a businessperson thinking about setting up a sardine factory, you’d be put off by a lack of other industries in the country. Ports, metal plants and shipyards depend on each other and need to be built together. Developing countries had to go from having nothing to having everything, and Rosenstein-Rodan argued that only the government could time the leap accurately. It had to make massive investments in many areas of the economy. He called it the ‘big push’.

Today economists constantly talk about ‘human capital’, the idea that people contribute to production like a machine does, and that people can enhance their human capital and job prospects by getting educational qualifications. People were outraged when Becker proposed the idea. Today, the notion that students go to university to gain skills that will help them get high-paying jobs when they graduate is barely questioned.

Solow–and in parallel with him, a now overlooked Australian economist, Trevor Swan (1918–89)–devised a theory to explain how economies grow during normal times when they’re using all available resources to produce goods. They ask us to imagine a simplified world in which goods are made using capital (machines and factories) and labour. A society can produce goods using different combinations of capital and labour: it could dig a train tunnel using a few mechanical diggers and hundreds of people with shovels, or using lots of mechanical diggers and only a few people to drive them. Rich countries are those with a lot of capital compared to the population. That means they’re able to produce a lot of output for each person. It’s output per person that’s the proper measure of how rich a society is. A society of ten people that produces goods worth £100 is twice as rich as a society of twenty producing the same amount. The society of ten can provide on average double the amount of goods to each of its people, and they have a higher standard of living than the society of twenty. Solow’s theory is about explaining growth in the crucial measure of income per person.

Diminishing returns to capital means that as an economy adds more to its stock of capital and produces more, its rate of growth tapers off. Eventually, all the gains from extra capital are exhausted. If capital was the only thing that created economic growth, then the economy would end up in a position in which there was no growth in income per person. In fact, there is something that creates growth in income per person in the long run: technological improvements. In economic terms, technology is a recipe that makes inputs, such as cloth, thread and metal, into outputs, such as a pair of jeans. The recipe is knowledge: how to cut cloth, how to sew the pieces together, and so on. Knowledge advances when someone invents a more efficient sewing technique. Jeans can then be made more easily. The economy becomes more ‘productive’. Technological progress allows more to be made with the capital and labour that a country has. It also creates completely new goods. Societies progress as they move from stone tablets to parchment, from parchment to paper and from paper to digital tablets. It’s higher productivity stemming from technological advancement, says Solow, which is the true engine of growth.

Prebisch said that this was wrong. Poor countries like Cuba tended to export ‘primary’ products such as sugar, coffee and bananas. Rich countries tended to export manufactured products like television sets and cars. When people get richer they spend more on television sets and cars but they don’t spend nearly as much extra on sugar and coffee.

Prebisch saw that this had a disturbing implication for poor countries. When the economy of a poor country grows, its demand for the cars that it imports from rich countries rises. But when a rich country grows, the country’s demand for the sugar that it imports from poor countries rises much more slowly. In consequence, the price of cars rises faster than the price of sugar: the poor country’s ‘terms of trade’ worsens. So when the population of the poor country demands more cars the country has to export ever more sugar to pay for them. It turns into a vicious cycle: the poor country specialises more in sugar production to pay for cars, but over time each tonne of sugar buys fewer cars. In the end the poor country can’t grow as fast as the rich country. A high rate of growth would create a high demand for cars that the country wouldn’t be able to satisfy with the revenues from its sugar exports. What a contrast with the cheerful outlook of the nineteenth-century economists! Now it seems that trade between rich and poor traps poor countries into exporting cheap sugar and coffee, and into always lagging behind the rich world.

What was the way out for poor countries? Prebisch said that they shouldn’t specialise, they should diversify–that is, make lots of different goods. They needed to produce sugar and coffee, and cars and television sets, too.

If people don’t spend, then the government must, said the Keynesians. It can stop the downward spiral by spending money on roads, on hospitals, on new pot plants for its offices, on pretty much anything in fact.

what the government does is to borrow the unspent savings that are sloshing around the economy and spend them itself; it redirects them back into the bath. In doing this, it spends more than it collects in taxes (a bit like when someone borrows money from a bank to buy a car and so spends more than they earn). The government runs a ‘budget deficit’. Later, when the economy picks up and more people are in work and earning money, the government collects a greater amount of taxes and the deficit disappears.

Another way is to cut taxes–Kennedy’s policy. It does much the same thing by putting more dollars in the hands of consumers. Even though consumers save some of the dollars, they also buy things, which pushes up spending in the economy.

Economists call any policy to do with government spending and taxing ‘fiscal’ policy. In ancient Rome, the fiscus was the treasure chest of the emperor, so fiscal policy is about the state filling up its coffers with taxes and emptying them by spending.

The starting point is to see that people have choices about what to do with their wealth. They can choose to keep it as plain old money, simple notes and coins that don’t earn them any interest. Alternatively they can buy financial products like bonds. Bonds are certificates that pay interest to whoever owns them. Firms or governments sell them to the public when they want to borrow money. When there’s a high rate of interest on bonds then people don’t want to keep their wealth as money that doesn’t pay them interest–they’d rather buy bonds. In this case, we say that the demand for money is low. In contrast, when interest rates are low, people’s demand for money is high. Suppose now that the government prints more dollars (increases the supply of money). For people to hold on to the extra, rather than use it to buy bonds, the interest rate must fall. The fall makes the supply of money equal the demand for it. What’s important here is that the lower interest rate affects businesspeople’s decisions. It isn’t worth building a new factory that promises them a certain profit when they have to pay a lot of interest on the money they borrow to build it. But when the interest rate is low enough, it is worth it. So a lower interest rate stimulates business investment. That means more spending in the economy and so higher national income and more jobs.


The starting point is to see that people have choices about what to do with their wealth. They can choose to keep it as plain old money, simple notes and coins that don’t earn them any interest.

Great Depression in the 1930s when interest rates were very low. If they were so low, why did the depression go on for so long, they wondered? They concluded that money and interest rates don’t affect overall demand in the economy that much. Keynesians came to believe that what really spurred investment was businesspeople’s feelings of optimism (what Keynes had called their ‘animal spirits’), not a low interest rate. The conventional

Politicians want to stay in power and so will do anything to avoid cutting spending and annoying them. In the end, spending keeps going up and up, and so does the government’s deficit. This is what Buchanan believed was happening in the 1960s.

To improve the government’s behaviour, Buchanan argues for constitutional rules such as one that makes it a legal requirement for the government not to spend more money than it collects in taxes–to have a ‘balanced budget’.

Critics of public choice, though, say that much of what governments do is essential.

suppose that in May the Mexican government sets a price for pesos in dollars. If in June the demand for pesos is higher than usual, then the government can print more pesos to keep their value from rising above the price it set. But if in July people buy a lot of dollars, and so sell more pesos than usual, then the price of pesos is in danger of falling. To keep it up, the government must buy pesos using its stock of dollars. Economists call this stock a country’s ‘foreign currency reserves’; they’re crucial for regulating the level of exchange rate.

Sen argues that by better understanding how fluctuations in markets can cause famines, more can be done to prevent them. For example, in the early 1970s a drought led to agricultural workers losing their jobs in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The government employed them to build roads and dig wells, which gave them a wage and protected their food entitlements. Famine was therefore averted. Sen says that democracy and a free press are essential to preventing famines. When journalists can write about the hardship faced by the poor, the government has an incentive to do something about it, otherwise it risks getting voted out of power at the next election. Sen believes that this is why there’s been no famine in India since its independence. On the other hand, the biggest famine of the twentieth century–that in China in the late 1950s, in which 30 million people died–went on for so long and killed so many because journalists weren’t free to write what they wanted. The Chinese government had launched its Great Leap Forward programme that aimed to modernise the economy, part of which was a disastrous reorganisation of agriculture. Without anyone reporting what it was doing, the government was able to go on with its policies at the cost of so many lives.

‘signalling’ to each other. For example, firms want to hire the most productive people, but people’s ability is hard to observe. One way that people signal their ability is by obtaining educational qualifications. Pushing the idea further, education might not make people that much better at their jobs; qualifications merely help employers to distinguish between productive and unproductive people.

A surprising feature of a lot of standard economic theory is that it says little about money and banks, the very things that you might expect it to be about. This is because the basic theory of markets is to do with the buying and selling of real things. You sell me potatoes so that you can buy yourself a scarf; what matters is how many potatoes you need to sell to get a scarf. Here money smooths the swapping of potatoes for scarves, but on its own it doesn’t do much. To Minsky this was the wrong way round. Money, and the banks that help create it by making loans, are what power the economy–and what eventually lead it into a crisis.

Minsky says that cautious capitalism gives way to daring capitalism: more people want to borrow, and banks want to lend to them because it makes them a profit. Banks start to compete for borrowers and so they invent new kinds of loans to give to borrowers with less ability to repay. They

At the start of our story we met the first people to think about economics: the philosophers of ancient Greece. They were concerned with life’s most fundamental questions, ones that we grapple with to this day. What does it take to live well in a human society? What do people need to be happy and fulfilled? What makes them truly thrive? That’s where economics started and, after all the arguments and disagreements, it’s where it must begin from again.
