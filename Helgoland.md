Quantum theory has clarified the foundations of chemistry, the functioning of atoms, of solids, of plasmas, of the color of the sky, the dynamics of the stars, the origins of galaxies . . . a thousand aspects of the world. It is at the basis of the latest technologies: from computers to nuclear power.


the electrons in atoms orbited around the nucleus only on certain precise orbits, at certain precise distances from the nucleus, with certain precise energies—before magically “leaping” from one orbit to another.


What we observe of an electron in an atom is the light emitted when, according to Bohr’s hypothesis, it leaps from one orbit to another. A leap involves two orbits: the one the electron leaves and the one it leaps to. Each observation can then be placed, as I have mentioned, in the entries of a table where the orbit of departure determines the row; the orbit of arrival, the column. Heisenberg’s idea is to write all the quantities which describe the movement of the electron—position, velocity, energy—no longer as numbers, but as tables of numbers. Instead of having a single position x for the electron, we have an entire table of possible positions X: one for every possible leap. The idea is to continue to use the same equations as always, simply replacing the usual quantities (position, velocity, energy and frequency of orbit and so on) with such tables.


Heisenberg immediately sees that the conceptual clarity of Schrödinger’s waves is a mirage. Sooner or later a wave spreads out and is spatially diffused; an electron does not: when it arrives from somewhere, it always arrives complete in a single point.


What Born understands is that the value of Schrödinger’s ψ wave at a point in space is related to the probability of observing the electron at this point.24 If an atom emits an electron and is surrounded by particle detectors, the value of ψ where there is a detector determines the probability of that detector, and not another, detecting the electron. Schrödinger’s ψ is therefore not a representation of a real entity: it is an instrument of calculation that gives the probability that something real will occur. It is like the weather forecasts telling us what could happen tomorrow. The same—it soon


Inside an oven, for example, electromagnetic waves behave in a curious way. The heat (that is, the energy) is not distributed among all frequencies, as we would naturally expect: it never reaches higher frequencies. In 1900, twenty-five years before Heisenberg’s journey to Helgoland, the German physicist Max Planck had discovered a formula that reproduced well the way that the energy of heat, measured in a laboratory, distributed among waves of different frequency.27 He derived this formula from general rules, but added a curious hypothesis: the energy could be transmitted to the waves only in integer multiples of elementary energies. In discrete packets. The dimensions of these packets, in order to make Planck’s calculation work, must be different for waves of different frequency: they must be proportional to the frequency.28 High-frequency waves can only receive more energetic packets. Energy does not reach the very high frequencies because there is not enough of it to transmit big enough packets.


Today we often use the symbol ħ, which stands for h divided by 2π. Dirac developed the habit of placing a small line through the h, because in calculations h is frequently divided by 2π, and he got tired of writing “h/2π” every time. The symbol ħ is called “h bar.” It has come to be called “Planck’s constant,” just


Einstein suggests that light and all the other electromagnetic waves are actually made up of elementary grains.29 These are the first “quanta.” Today we call them “photons,” the quanta of light. Planck’s constant h measures their size: every photon has an energy h times the frequency of the light of which it is part.


Planck’s constant h measures their size: every photon has an energy h times the frequency of the light of which it is part.


the theory doesn’t tell us where to find any one particle of matter when we are not looking at it. It only speaks about the probability of finding it at one point if we observe it.


“quantum superposition.” A quantum superposition is when two contradictory properties are, in a certain sense, present together. An object could be here but at the same time elsewhere. It is what Heisenberg means by saying that “the electron no longer has a trajectory”: the electron is found not to be only in one place or another. In a sense it is in both places.


This is quantum superposition: the photon is, so to say, “on both paths.” But if you search for it, it is only on one path.


For as Niels Bohr once said, you should “never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think.”


QBism abandons a realistic image of the world, beyond what we can see or measure. The theory gives us the probability that we will see something, and this is all that it is legitimate to say. It is not legitimate to say anything about the cat or the photon when we are not actually observing them.


central question raised by Heisenberg—what


central question raised by Heisenberg—what is an observation? what is an observer?—finally


Reality is a luxuriant stratification: snow-covered mountains and forests, the smiles of friends, the rumble of the subway on dirty winter mornings, our insatiable thirst, the dance of our fingers across a laptop keyboard, the taste of bread, the sorrow of the world, the night sky, the immensity of the stars, Venus shining alone in the ultramarine blue of twilight . . . Behind this disordered veil of appearances, we thought we had found the deep weave, the hidden order. This was the time in which things seemed simple. But the great hopes of the insignificant mortal critters that we are too often turn out to be short-lived dreams. The conceptual clarity of classical physics has been swept away by quanta. Reality is decidedly not how it is described by classical physics.


Not to fear rethinking the world is the power of science: ever since Anaximander removed the foundations on which the Earth rested, Copernicus launched it to rotate in the sky, Einstein dissolved the rigidity of space and of time, and Darwin demolished the separateness of humanity . . . reality is constantly being redrawn in images that are increasingly effective.


What quantum theory describes, then, is the way in which one part of nature manifests itself to any other single part of nature.


The world that we observe is continuously interacting. It is a dense web of interactions.


Individual objects are the way in which they interact. If there was an object that had no interactions, no effect upon anything, emitted no light, attracted nothing and repelled nothing, was not touched and had no smell . . . it would be as good as nonexistent.


Bohr speaks of the “impossibility of neatly separating the behavior of atomic systems from their interaction with the measuring device used to define the conditions under which the phenomenon appears.”


This is the significance of Heisenberg’s original intuition: to ask what the orbit of an electron is when it is not interacting with anything is an empty question. The electron does not follow an orbit because its physical properties are only those that determine how it affects something else, for instance, the light that it emits when it is interacting. If the electron is not interacting, there are no properties.


Facts that are real with respect to an object are not necessarily so with respect to another.* A property may be real with respect to a stone, and not real with respect to another stone.55


The discovery of quantum theory is only slightly more radical: it is the discovery that all the properties (variables) of all objects are relational, just as in the case of speed.


The discovery of quantum theory is only slightly more radical: it is the discovery that all the properties (variables) of all objects are relational, just as in the case of speed. Physical variables do not describe things: they describe the way in which things manifest themselves to each other.


Cosmological Koans, Anthony Aguirre describes this disconcerting conclusion in the following way: An electron is a particular type of regularity that appears among measurements and observations that we make. It is more pattern than a substance. It is order . . . Thus we arrive at a strange place. We break things down into smaller and smaller pieces, but then the pieces, when examined, are not there. Just the arrangements of them are. What then, are things, like the boat, or its sails, or your fingernails? What are they? If things are forms of forms of forms of forms, and if forms are order, and order is defined by us . . . they exist, it would appear, only as created by, and in relation to, us and the Universe. They are, the Buddha might say, emptiness.


This can be summarized in two general facts that radically differentiate quantum physics from classical physics, encapsulating the novelty of the quanta:69 The maximal amount of relevant information about an object70 is finite. It is always possible to acquire new relevant information about any object. These two facts are so basic that they are called “postulates.” At first glance the two postulates appear to contradict each other. If the information is finite, how is it always possible to obtain more of it? The contradiction is only apparent, however, because the postulates refer to “relevant” information. Relevant information is that which counts for predicting the future behavior of the object. When we acquire new information, part of the old information becomes “irrelevant”: that is to say, it does not change what can be said about the future.


If we could know with infinite precision all the physical variables that describe a thing, we would have infinite information. But this is impossible. The limit is determined by the Planck constant ħ.73 This is the meaning of Planck’s constant. It is the limit up to which we can determine physical variables.


“Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.” It applies to everything.


“Noncommutative” means: such that their order cannot be changed freely.


But at the molecular scale, the cutting edge of a sharp knife is as fluctuating and imprecise as the edge of an ocean in a storm, fraying upon the white sand of its shore.


The well-defined and solid picture of the world given by the old physics is an illusion. On April 18, 1947, on the sacred island of Helgoland, the Royal Navy blows up three thousand nine hundred ninety-seven tons of dynamite—what was left of munitions abandoned there by the German army.


Ernst Mach.85 In short, Mach stands at a remarkable crossroads of science, politics, philosophy and literature. And some people still view the natural sciences, humanities and literature as unconnected!


The “anti-metaphysical” spirit that Mach promoted is an attitude of openness: We should not seek to teach the world how it should be. Let’s listen to the world instead, in order to learn from it how to think about

When Einstein objected to quantum mechanics by remarking that “God does not play dice,” Bohr responded by admonishing him, “Stop telling God what to do.” Which means: Nature is richer than our metaphysical prejudices. It has more imagination than we do.


We must take seriously the new things we learn about the world, even if they clash with our preconceptions about how reality is constituted.


The central point is simpler: the properties of an object become manifest when this object interacts with others.


The technical term used by Nāgārjuna to describe the absence of independent existence is “emptiness” (śūnyatā): things are “empty” in the sense of having no autonomous existence.


I believe that one of the greatest mistakes made by human beings is to want certainties when trying to understand something. The search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty: it is nourished by a radical absence of certainty. Thanks to the acute awareness of our ignorance, we are open to doubt and can continue to learn and to learn better.


Aristotle tells us in his Physics how Empedocles had suggested that life was the result of the casual formation of structures due to the normal combination of things. Most of these structures quickly perish, with the exception of those having the characteristics to survive: these are the living organisms.


Aristotle objects that we invariably see calves born “well structured”: we do not see every possible variety of shape brought forth, with only the most adequate surviving.123 But today it has become clear that Empedocles’s idea, transferred from individuals to species and enriched by what we have learned about heredity and genetics, is

The principal means of this stability are the molecules of DNA, which remain more or less similar to their ancestors. This implies that there are correlations, that is to say relative information, across eons of time. The molecules of DNA codify and transmit information. This informational stability is perhaps the most characteristic aspect of living matter.


But quantum physics is the discovery that the physical world is a web of correlations: relative information. The things of nature are not collections of isolated elements in haughty individualism.


Ὁ κόσμος άλλοίωσις, ὁ βίος ὑπόληψις. The cosmos is change, life is discourse—as the fragment 115 by Democritus has it. The cosmos is interaction; life organizes relative information.


Every cell is a city, every protein a castle of atoms; in each atomic nucleus an inferno of quantum dynamics is stirring, quarks and gluons swirl, excitations of quantum fields.

This is only a small wood on a small planet that revolves around a little star, among one hundred billion stars in one of the thousand billion galaxies constellated with dazzling cosmic events.


One of the most fascinating recent developments in neuroscience concerns the functioning of our visual system. How do we see? How do we know that what we have in front of us is a book, or a cat? It would seem natural to think that receptors detect the light that reaches the retinas of our eyes and transform it into signals that race to the interior of the brain, where groups of neurons elaborate the information in ever more complex ways, until they interpret it and identify the objects in question. Neurons recognize lines that separate colors, other neurons recognize shapes drawn by these lines, others again check these shapes against data stored in our memory. Others still arrive at the recognition: it’s a cat. It turns out, however, that the brain does not work like this at all. It functions, in fact, in an opposite way. Many, if not most, of the signals do not travel from the eyes to the brain; they go the other way, from the brain to the eyes.132 What happens is that the brain expects to see something, on the basis of what it knows and has previously occurred. The brain elaborates an image of what it predicts the eyes should see. This information is conveyed from the brain to the eyes, through intermediate stages. If a discrepancy is revealed between what the brain expects and the light arriving into the eyes, only then do the neural circuits send signals toward the brain. So images from around us do not travel from the eyes to the brain—only news of discrepancies regarding what the brain expects do. The discovery that sight functions in this way came as a surprise. But if we think about it, it becomes clear that this is the most efficient way of retrieving information from the surroundings. What would be the point of sending signals toward the brain that do nothing but confirm what it already knows? Information technology uses similar techniques to compress files of images: instead of putting into the memory the color of all the pixels, it stores information only on where the colors change. That is less information, but enough to reconstruct the images.


Hippolyte Taine, we can say that “external perception is an internal dream which proves to be in harmony with external things; and instead of calling ‘hallucination’ a false perception, we must call external perception ‘a confirmed hallucination.’”


Prospero in the epigraph to this chapter: “And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, / The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve, / And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, / Leave not a rack behind.”


“We are such stuff / As dreams are made on, and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep.”


Every vision is partial. There is no way of seeing reality that is not dependent on a perspective—no point of view that is absolute and universal.
