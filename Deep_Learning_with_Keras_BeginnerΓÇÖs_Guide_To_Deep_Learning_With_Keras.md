For instance, a linear neuron takes a linear combination of its weighted inputs while sigmoidal neurons feed the specific weighted sum of its inputs into a logistic function.


Convolutional neural networks or also known as CNN and are one of the most commonly used types of feed-forward neural networks in that the connectivity pattern between neurons is based on the organization of the common visual cortex system. Therefore, the V1 or the primary visual cortex does edge detection out of raw visual input obtained from the retina. Then, the V2 or secondary visual cortex receives the edge features from the primary visual cortex and extracts simple visual properties such as spatial frequency, orientation, and color.

Then, all those processed visual features flow into the final unit named inferior temporal gyrus of IT for further object recognition. This specific shortcut between V1 layer and V4 layer, in fact, inspired a certain type of convolutional neural networks with connections between those non-adjacent layers named residual net.

Convolution is commonly used in mathematical terms referring to an operation between matrices as convolutional layers which generally have a small matrix named filter or kernel. As the filter or kernel is sliding or convolving across these matrices of input images, it


RNN or recurrent neural networks are greatly suitable for these purposes as they have shown an amazing improvement in problems like speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.


LTSM models are smart enough to learn long-term context. These models can learn for how long they should memorize the old information, when to forget information, when to use newly updated data, and when to combine the new input with old memory.


sequence-to-sequence model

Autoencoders are designed mainly to learn low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data sets very similar to what PCA or principal components analysis does.


Reinforcement learning is one of the secrets behind many successful AI projects done in the past.


generative adversarial network or GAN. This is a type of deep generative algorithm. GAN has the power of creating new examples after going through and learning some of the real data.

Notes: 1)  psydo random number is follows some kin sequence with very very large period and therefore seems random though they are part of a pattern. Seed during random number generation is actually the starting point in the sequence. If we use same seed Every time, it will generate same sequence of random numbers.

In summary, the construction of deep learning models in Keras can be explained as defining your model, compiling your model, fitting your model and making predictions. To define it, you must create a sequence and add multiple layers. Once done, you compile your model by specifying optimizer and loss functions. Then, you must fit your model by executing the model using data. Finally, you make predictions on new data.


Whenever we work with deep learning models which use a stochastic process like random numbers, it is a very good idea to set the random number seed. This is a good idea as you will be able to run the same code over and over and get the same result.
