Vata, Pitta and Kapha are effectively Air, Fire and Water respectively.


Vata, Pitta and Kapha are effectively Air, Fire and Water respectively. Vata, which is the principle of kinetic energy in the body, is mainly concerned with the nervous system, and controls all body movement. Kapha, the principle of potential energy, controls body stability and lubrication. The tissues and wastes of the body, which Vata moves around, are Kapha’s province. Pitta controls the body’s balance of kinetic and potential energies. All of Pitta’s processes involve digestion or “cooking,” even if it is the cooking of thoughts into theories in the mind. The enzymatic and endocrine systems are Pitta’s main field of activity.


These three are forces, not substances. Kapha is not mucus; it is the force which when projected into the body causes mucus to arise. Pitta is not bile; it is the force that causes bile to be produced. Vata is not gas, but increased Vata increases gas.

Since sugar’s sole Taste is Sweet, it becomes just like soluble sand. Apples retain their Sourness even after the Sweet is gone;

EFFECTS OF OVERUSE


The Sanskrit word rasa means, among other things, both “taste” and “emotion.” This suggests that Taste and emotion are identical forces on different planes of existence, that Taste is to the body what emotion is to the mind.


Salty is called “all-tastes” (sarva rasa in Sanskrit)


Ayurveda teaches us that the Bitter Taste is in small doses a tonic for the appetite and digestion. It works this way in the world as well, for a little dissatisfaction can spur you on to greater and greater appetites. Too much dissatisfaction though and you will end up with an excess of Bitterness in your organism.
