Life of the Buddha as it appears in the Pali Canon, the Oldest Authentic Record,


Haad jaley lakdi jaley, jaley jalaawan haar Kautik haaraa bhi jaley, kaasun karun pukaar


Easy is a good act to the good, a good act is hard to the wicked; Easy is evil to the evil, but evil is hard for the Noble Ones to do.


Truly its fruit the plantain doth destroy, Their fruit destroys the bamboo and the rush; So homage doth destroy the fool, Just as its embryo the mule.


Imagine, Ananda, a cesspool, of a man’s depth, brimful of dung and a man fallen in, head and all—though a man appear, ready to help, to do the friendly, to set him in safety, to lift him out; yet were he to go all round that cesspool, he would not see even the prick-end of a horse-hair of that man unsmeared with dung by which to grasp and lift him out. And it is even so with Devadatta, Ananda, when I saw not a bright spot in him—not even the prick-end of a horse-hair in size—then I declared: ‘Gone wayward, hell-bound for a kalpa, unpardonable is Devadatta.’ 9


That is why, the Buddha counsels, it is well for a monk—and surely, for each of us—‘to review, from time to time, his own faults . . . another’s faults . . . his own attainments . . . another’s attainments’. And to dissolve by mindfulness the obsessions and ill-intentions that arise. 10


‘Why, Ananda,’ the Buddha asks, ‘when Saariputta attained final Nibbana, did he take away your aggregate of virtue, or your aggregate of concentration, or your aggregate of wisdom, or your aggregate of liberation, or your aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation?’


all conditioned things are of a nature to decay—strive on untiringly.’ ‘These were the Tathagata’s last words,’ the Sutta records.
