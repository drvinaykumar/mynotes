Children grow up and discover that the world is not as it seemed from within the four walls of their homes. Humankind as a whole does the same.


since what lies between them is only space and time, he imagined that the sun and the Earth each modified the space and time that surrounded them, just as a body immersed in water displaces the water around it.

This modification of the structure of time influences in turn the movement of bodies, causing them to “fall” toward each other.

Notes: 1) Anaximander 


This is how time is depicted in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. His equations do not have a single “time”; they have innumerable times. Between two events, just as between the two clocks that are separated and then brought together again, the duration is not a single one.8 Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.*


We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps.


We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible. . . . Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.


All of the sons of Adam are part of one single body, They are of the same essence. When time afflicts us with pain In one part of that body All the other parts feel it too. If you fail to feel the pain of others You do not deserve the name of man.

The crucial point here is the difference from what happens with falling bodies: a ball may fall, but it can also come back up, by rebounding, for instance. Heat cannot. This is the only basic law of physics that distinguishes the past from the future.


Clausius introduces a quantity that measures this irreversible progress of heat in only one direction and, since he was a cultivated German, he gives it a name taken from ancient Greek—entropy:


Clausius’s entropy, indicated by the letter S, is a measurable and calculable quantity 15 that increases or remains the same but never decreases, in an isolated process. In order to indicate that it never decreases, we write: ΔS ≥ 0 This reads: “Delta S is always greater than or equal to zero,” and we call this “the second principle of thermodynamics”


It is the only equation of fundamental physics that knows any difference between past and future. The only one that speaks of the flowing of time. Behind this unusual equation, an entire world lies hidden.


The question now becomes: why, in one of the two directions of time—the one we call past—were things more ordered? Why was the great pack of cards of the universe in order in the past? Why, in the past, was entropy lower? If we observe a phenomenon that begins in a state of lower entropy, it is clear why entropy increases—because in the process of reshuffling, everything becomes disordered. But why do the phenomena that we observe around us in the cosmos begin in a state of lower entropy in the first place?


He has demonstrated that entropy is precisely the quantity that counts how many are the different configurations that our blurred vision does not distinguish between.


Time passes more slowly for the one who keeps moving.


“Proper time” depends not only on where you are and your degree of proximity to masses; it depends also on the speed at which you move.


if you look at your sister, you are receiving light that travels from her to your eyes. The light takes time to reach you, let’s say a few nanoseconds—a tiny fraction of a second—therefore, you are not quite seeing what she is doing now but what she was doing a few nanoseconds ago.


Our “present” does not extend throughout the universe. It is like a bubble around us.


A partial order establishes a relation of before and after between certain elements, but not between any two of them. Human beings form a “partially ordered” set (not a “completely ordered” set) through filiation. Filiation establishes an order (before the descendants, after the forebears), but not between everyone.


Every event has its past, its future, and a part of the universe that is neither past nor future, just as every person has forebears, descendants, and others who are neither forebears nor descendants.


a common present does not exist: the temporal structure of spacetime is not a stratification of times such as this: It is, rather, a structure made up entirely of light cones: This is the structure of spacetime that Einstein understood when he was twenty-five years old. Ten years later, he comes to understand that the speed at which time flows changes from place to place. It follows that spacetime does not really have the order outlined above but can be distorted. It now looks rather more like this: When a gravitational wave passes, for example, the small light cones oscillate together from right to left, like ears of wheat blown by the wind. The structure of the cones can even be such that, advancing always toward the future, one can return to the same point in spacetime, like this: In this way, a continuous trajectory toward the future returns to the originating event, to where it began.*32 The first to realize this was Kurt Gödel, the great twentieth-century logician who was Einstein’s last friend, accompanying him on walks along the streets of Princeton.

Near to a black hole, the lines converge toward it, like this:33 This is because the mass of the black hole slows time to such a degree that, at its border (called the “horizon”), time stands still. If you look closely, you will see that the surface of the black hole is parallel to the edges of the cones. So, in order to exit from a black hole, you would need to move (like the trajectory marked in dark gray in the following diagram) toward the present rather than toward the future! This is impossible. Objects can only move toward the future, as in the trajectories outlined in the diagram in white. This is what constitutes a black hole: an inclination of the light cones toward the interior, marking a horizon, closing off a region of space in the future from everything that surrounds it. It is nothing other than this. It is the curious local structure of the present that produces black holes.

“How long is forever?” asks Alice. “Sometimes, just one second,” replies the White Rabbit.


But for most of those centuries, however, hours were longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, because the twelve hours divided the time between dawn and sunset: the first hour was dawn, and the twelfth was sunset, regardless of the season, as we read in the parable of the winegrower in the Gospel according to Matthew.


A train station in Paris kept its own hour, a little behind the rest of the city, as a kind of courtesy toward travelers running late.39


There are chemical mechanisms that keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even in the biochemistry of single cells.


Aristotle is the first we are aware of to have asked himself the question “What is time?,” and he came to the following conclusion: time is the measurement of change.


“true” time that passes regardless, independently of things and of their changes. If all things remained motionless and even the movements of our souls were to be frozen, this time would continue to pass, according to Newton, unaffected and equal to itself: “true” time. It’s the exact opposite of what Aristotle writes.


Aristotle: Time is nothing other than the measurement of change.


time that is “absolute, true, and mathematical,” assumed by Newton to run independently of things that change or things that move.


the existence of a time that is uniform, independent of things and of their movement that today seems so natural to us is not an ancient intuition that is natural to humanity itself. It’s an idea of Newton’s.


time (the measure of “when” with regard to events, as Aristotle wanted; the entity that runs even when nothing happens, according to Newton)


Aristotle was the first to discuss in depth and with acuity the meaning of “space,” or “place,” and to arrive at a precise definition: the place of a thing is what surrounds that thing.


The synthesis between Aristotle’s time and Newton’s is the most valuable achievement made by Einstein. It is the crowning jewel of his thought.


The answer is that the time and space Newton had intuited the existence of, beyond tangible matter, do effectively exist. They are real. Time and space are real phenomena. But they are in no way absolute; they are not at all independent from what happens; they are not as different from the other substances of the world, as Newton had imagined them to be. We can think of a great Newtonian canvas on which the story of the world is drawn. But this canvas is made of the same stuff that everything else in the world is made of, the same substance that constitutes stone, light, and air: it is made of fields.

Remember the clocks in chapter 1 that slow down in the vicinity of a mass? They slow down because there is, in a precise sense, “less” gravitational field there. There is less time there.


You will obtain something like the image below, which represents space (the height, on the vertical axis) and time (on the horizontal)—but, now, the “longer” time in the mountains effectively corresponds to a greater length of time. The image above illustrates what physicists call “curved” spacetime. “Curved” because it is distorted: distances are stretched and contracted, just like the elastic sheet when it is pulled. This is why the light cones were inclined in the diagrams in chapter 3. Time thus becomes part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space. This is the synthesis that Einstein found between Aristotle’s conception of time and Newton’s. With a tremendous beat of his wings, Einstein understands that Aristotle and Newton are both right. Newton is right in intuiting that something else exists in addition to the simple things that we see moving and changing. True and mathematical Newtonian time exists; it is a real entity; it is the gravitational field, the elastic sheet, the curved spacetime in the diagram. But Newton is wrong in assuming that this time is independent from things—and that it passes regularly, imperturbably, separately, from everything else. For his part, Aristotle is right to say that “when” and “where” are always located in relation to something. But this something can also be just the field, the spatiotemporal entity of Einstein. Because this is a dynamic and concrete entity, like all those in reference to which, as Aristotle rightly observed, we are capable of locating ourselves.


The “quantization” of time implies that almost all values of time t do not exist. If we could measure the duration of an interval with the most precise clock imaginable, we should find that the time measured takes only certain discrete, special values.


Granularity is ubiquitous in nature: light is made of photons, the particles of light. The energy of electrons in atoms can acquire only certain values and not others. The purest air is granular, and so, too, is the densest matter. Once it is understood that Newton’s space and time are physical entities like all others, it is natural to suppose that they are also granular.


it is not possible to predict exactly, for instance, where an electron will appear tomorrow. Between one appearance and another, the electron has no precise position,55 as if it were dispersed in a cloud of probability.


the electron is concrete only in relation to the other physical objects it is interacting with.


It is hard to take in the idea that an electron behaves in such a bizarre way. It is even more difficult to digest that this is also the way time and space behave. And yet, according to all the evidence, this is the way the quantum world works: the world that we inhabit.


The substratum that determines the duration of time is not an independent entity, different from the others that make up the world; it is an aspect of a dynamic field. It jumps, fluctuates, materializes only by interacting, and is not to be found beneath a minimum scale. . . . So, after all this, what is left of time?


None of the pieces that time has lost (singularity, direction, independence, the present, continuity) puts into question the fact that the world is a network of events. On the one hand, there was time, with its many determinations; on the other,


None of the pieces that time has lost (singularity, direction, independence, the present, continuity) puts into question the fact that the world is a network of events. On the one hand, there was time, with its many determinations; on the other, the simple fact that nothing is: things happen.


The events of the world do not form an orderly queue, like the English. They crowd around chaotically, like Italians.


The difference between things and events is that things persist in time; events have a limited duration. A stone is a prototypical “thing”: we can ask ourselves where it will be tomorrow. Conversely, a kiss is an “event.” It makes no sense to ask where the kiss will be tomorrow. The world is made up of networks of kisses, not of stones.


to—Anaximander’s exhortation remains valid: we understand the world by studying change, not by studying things.


to—Anaximander’s exhortation remains valid: we understand the world by studying change, not by studying things. Those who have neglected this good advice have paid a heavy price for it. Two of the greats who fell into this error were Plato and Kepler, both curiously seduced by the same mathematics.


The fact that we cannot arrange the universe like a single orderly sequence of times does not mean that nothing changes. It means that changes are not arranged in a single orderly succession: the temporal structure of the world is more complex than a simple single linear succession of instants. This does not mean that it is nonexistent or illusory.


Nature, for its part, is what it is—and we discover it very gradually.


The relations of spatial adjacency tie the grains of space into webs. We call these “spin networks.” The name “spin” comes from the mathematics that describe the grains of space.75 A ring in the spin network is called a “loop,” and these are the loops that give “loop theory” its name.


There is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to weep and a time to dance, a time to kill and a time to heal. A time to destroy and a time to build.


A group of boys on a field decide to have a match. They form teams. This is how we used to do it: the two most enterprising would take turns choosing the players they wanted, having tossed a coin to see who would have first pick. At the end of this solemn procedure, there were two teams. Where were the teams before they were chosen? Nowhere. They emerged from the procedure.


In the mountains, we see a valley covered by a sea of white clouds. The surface of the clouds gleams, immaculate. We start to walk toward the valley. The air becomes more humid, then less clear; the sky is no longer blue. We find ourselves in a fog. Where did the well-defined surface of the clouds go? It vanished. Its disappearance is gradual; there is no surface that separates the fog from the sparse air of the heights. Was it an illusion? No, it was a view from afar. Come to think of it, it’s like this with all surfaces. This dense marble table would look like a fog if I were shrunk to a small enough, atomic scale. Everything in the world becomes blurred when seen close up.


Everything in the world becomes blurred when seen close up.


something that is real—a cat, a football team, high and low, the surface of clouds, the rotation of the cosmos—emerges from a world that at a much simpler level has no cats, teams, up or down, no surfaces of clouds, no revolving cosmos. . . . Time emerges from a world without time, in a way that has something in common with each of these examples.

PERSPECTIVE


Between ourselves and the rest of the world there are physical interactions. Obviously, not all the variables of the world interact with us, or with the segment of the world to which we belong. Only a very minute fraction of these variables does so; most of them do not react with us at all. They do not register us, and we do not register them. This is why distinct configurations of the world seem equivalent to us. The physical interaction between myself and a glass of water—two pieces of the world—is independent of the motion of the single molecules of water. In the same way, the physical interaction between myself and a distant galaxy—two pieces of the world—ignores what happens in detail out there. Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. This blurring is at the heart of Boltzmann’s theory.93 From this blurring, the concepts of heat and entropy are born—and these are linked to the phenomena that characterize the flow of time. The entropy of a system depends explicitly on blurring. It depends on what I do not register, because it depends on the number of indistinguishable configurations. The same microscopic configuration may be of high entropy with regard to one blurring and of low in relation to another.


Take a pack of twelve cards, six red and six black. Arrange it so that the red cards are all at the front. Shuffle the pack a little and then look for the black cards that have ended up among the red ones. Before shuffling, there are none; after, some. This is a basic example of the growth of entropy. At the start of the game, the number of black cards among the red in the first half of the pack is zero (the entropy is low) because it has started in a special configuration.


It is what philosophers call “indexicality”: the characteristic of certain words that have a different meaning every time they are used, a meaning determined by where, how, when, and by whom they are being spoken. Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.


WHAT EMERGES FROM A PARTICULARITY


Why do the tall pine and the pale poplar intertwine their branches to provide such sweet shade for us? Why does the fleeting water invent bright spirals in the turbulent stream?


But there is something that does not add up. Energy—as I was also told at school—is conserved. It is neither created nor destroyed. If it is conserved, why do we have to constantly resupply it? Why can’t we just keep using the same energy? The truth is that there is plenty of energy and it is not consumed. It’s not energy that the world needs in order to keep going. What it needs is low entropy. Energy (be it mechanical, chemical, electrical, or potential) transforms itself into thermal energy, that is to say, into heat: it goes into cold things, and there is no free way of getting it back from there to reuse it to make a plant grow, or to power a motor. In this process, the energy remains the same but the entropy increases, and it is this which cannot be turned back. The second law of thermodynamics demands it. What makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium—there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen. Near to the Earth we have a rich source of low entropy: the sun. The sun sends us hot photons. Then the Earth radiates heat toward the black sky, emitting colder photons. The energy that enters is more or less equal to the energy that exits; consequently, we do not generally gain energy in the exchange. (Gaining energy in the exchange is disastrous for us: it is global warming.) But for every hot photon that arrives, the Earth emits ten cold ones, since a hot photon from the sun has the same energy as ten cold photons emitted by the Earth. The hot photon has less entropy than the ten cold photons, because the number of configurations of a single (hot) photon is lower than the number of configurations of ten (cold) photons. Therefore, the sun is a continual rich source of low entropy for us. We have at our disposal an abundance of low entropy, and it is this that allows plants and animals to grow, enables us to build motors and cities—and to think and to write books such as this one.


A pile of wood, for example, lasts a long time if left alone. It is not in a state of maximum entropy, because the elements of which it is made, such as carbon and hydrogen, are combined in a very particular manner (“ordered”) to give form to the wood. Entropy grows if these particular combinations are broken down. This is what happens when wood burns: its elements disengage from the particular structures that form wood and entropy increases sharply (fire being, in fact, a markedly irreversible process).


A stone falls to the ground. Why? One often reads that it’s because the stone places itself “in a state of lower energy” that it ends up lower down. But why does the stone put itself into a state of lower energy? Why should it lose energy if energy is conserved? The answer is that when the stone hits the Earth, it warms it: its mechanical energy is transformed into heat. And there is no way back from there. If the second law of thermodynamics did not exist, if heat did not exist, if there existed no microscopic swarming, the stone would rebound perpetually; it would never land and be still. It is entropy, not energy, that keeps stones on the ground and the world turning.


spreads.99 What causes events to happen in the world, what writes its history, is the irresistible mixing of all things, going from the few ordered configurations to the countless disordered ones. The entire universe is like a mountain that collapses in slow motion. Like a structure that very gradually crumbles. From the most minute events to the more complex ones, it is this dance of ever-increasing entropy, nourished by the initial low entropy of the universe, that is the real dance of Shiva, the destroyer.


Are the wheels the chariot? Is the axle? Is the chassis the chariot? Is the chariot the sum of its parts? The king replies cautiously that certainly “chariot” refers only to the relationship among the ensemble of wheels, axle, and chassis, to their working together and in relation to us—and that there does not exist an entity “chariot” beyond these relations and events. Nāgasena triumphs: in the same way as “chariot,” the name “Nāgasena” designates nothing more than a collection of relations and events.

what is it that founds our identity and its unity? What makes it so—that I am Carlo—and that my hair and my nails and my feet are considered part of me, as well as my anger and my dreams, and that I consider myself to be the same Carlo as yesterday, the same as tomorrow; the one who thinks, suffers, and perceives? There are different ingredients that combine to produce our identity. Three of these are important for the argument of this book:

We are histories of ourselves, narratives. I am not this momentary mass of flesh reclined on the sofa typing the letter a on my laptop; I am my thoughts full of the traces of the phrases that I am writing; I am my mother’s caresses, and the serene kindness with which my father calmly guided me; I am my adolescent travels; I am what my reading has deposited in layers in my mind; I am my loves, my moments of despair, my friendships, what I’ve written, what I’ve heard; the faces engraved on my memory. I am, above all, the one who a minute ago made a cup of tea for himself. The one who a moment ago typed the word “memory” into his computer. The one who just composed the sentence that I am now completing. If all this disappeared, would I still exist? I am this long, ongoing novel. My life consists of it. It


It is within my mind, then, that I measure time. I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective. When I measure time, I am measuring something in the present of my mind. Either this is time, or I have no idea what time is.


Augustine’s exposition of the idea is quite beautiful. It is based on our experience of music. When we listen to a hymn, the meaning of a sound is given by the ones that come before and after it. Music can occur only in time, but if we are always in the present moment, how is it possible to hear it? It is possible, Augustine observes, because our consciousness is based on memory and on anticipation. A hymn, a song, is in some way present in our minds in a unified form, held together by something—by that which we take time to be. And hence this is what time is: it is entirely in the present, in our minds, as memory and as anticipation.

Notes: 1) Since hymns arr metaphorical, our mind predicts the future words and adjusts the meanings of past and the presednt words. Some hymns seem extremly beautiful if it is the last word which changes our predicted meaning. An element of surprise is what makes poetry so beautiful. 


Synapses are continually formed in their thousands and then erased—especially during sleep, leaving behind a blurry reflection of that which has acted on our nervous system in the past.


What causes us to suffer is not in the past or the future: it is here, now, in our memory, in our expectations. We long for timelessness, we endure the passing of time: we suffer time. Time is suffering.

The closer we are to a mass (chapter 1), or the faster we move (chapter 3), the more time slows down: there is no single duration between two events; there are many possible ones.


The closer we are to a mass (chapter 1), or the faster we move (chapter 3), the more time slows down: there is no single duration between two events; there are many possible ones. The rhythms at which time flows are determined by the gravitational field, a real entity with its own dynamic that is described in the equations of Einstein.

In the elementary grammar of the world, there is neither space nor time—only processes that transform physical quantities from one to another, from which it is possible to calculate probabilities and relations (chapter 5). At the most fundamental level that we currently know of, therefore, there is little that resembles time as we experience it. There is no special variable “time,” there is no difference between past and future, there is no spacetime


Perhaps we belong to a particular subset of the world that interacts with the rest of it in such a way that this entropy is lower in one direction of our thermal time. The directionality of time is therefore real but perspectival (chapter 10): the entropy of the world in relation to us increases with our thermal time. We see the occurrence of things ordered in this variable, which we simply call “time,” and the growth of entropy distinguishes the past from the future for us and leads to the unfolding of the cosmos. It determines the existence of traces, residues, and memories of the past


When we cannot formulate a problem with precision, it is often not because the problem is profound: it’s because the problem is false.


We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come. The clearing that is opened up in this way, by memory and by anticipation, is time: a source of anguish sometimes, but in the end a tremendous gift.


(“The Earth has lost its youthfulness; it is past, like a happy dream. Now every day brings us closer to destruction, to desert,” as Vyasa has it in the Mahābhārata.


We think of the world in terms of stones, mountains, clouds, and people, and this is “the world for us.” About the world independent of us we know a good deal, without knowing how much this good deal is.


order to make advances in our understanding of the world, it is not always necessary to have new data. Copernicus had no more observational data than Ptolemy: he was able to deduce heliocentrism from the data available to Ptolemy by interpreting it better—as Einstein did with regard to Maxwell.
