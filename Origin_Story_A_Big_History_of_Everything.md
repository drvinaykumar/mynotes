Blaise Pascal wrote: “Knowledge is like a sphere; the greater its volume, the larger its contact with the unknown.”


Bootstrapping is the impossible task of lifting yourself into the air by pulling really, really hard on your bootstraps. The idea entered computer jargon (booting or rebooting) to describe how computers wake up from the dead and then load instructions telling them what to do next.


Isaac Newton saw God as the “first cause” of everything and argued that He was present in all of space. That is why Newton thought that the universe as a whole did not change much. The universe, he once wrote, was “the Sensorium of a Being incorporeal, living, and intelligent.”1 Early in the twentieth century, Einstein was so sure the universe was unchanging (at large scales) that he added a special constant to his theory of relativity to make it predict a stable universe.


But quantum physics tells us, and particle accelerators—which speed up subatomic particles to high velocities by means of electric or electromagnetic fields—show us, that something really can appear in a vacuum from nothing,


But quantum physics tells us, and particle accelerators—which speed up subatomic particles to high velocities by means of electric or electromagnetic fields—show us, that something really can appear in a vacuum from nothing, though grasping what this means requires a sophisticated understanding of nothing. In modern quantum physics, it is impossible to determine precisely the position and motion of subatomic particles. This means you can never say for sure that a particular region of space is empty, and that means that emptiness is tense with the possibility that something might appear. Like the “neither non-existence nor existence” of the Indian Vedas, this tension seems to have bootstrapped our universe.


with so much energy squashed up inside it, the primordial atom had to be inconceivably hot and had to be expanding like crazy to relieve the pressure.

Notes: 1) Like we have to expand to infinity to Get our energies released , there is no other way!! Fighting, anger etc can never satify our nature's demand of energy release...expansion is the only way. We cant expand externally so internal expansions is the path to tranqulity or equilibrium . 


We normally think of hydrogen and oxygen as colorless gases. But join two hydrogen atoms to a single oxygen atom in a particular configuration, and you get a molecule of water. Put lots of those molecules together, and you get the utterly new quality that we think of as “wateriness.”

Notes: 1) Like a vehicle when dismantled is difficult to be defined as a vehicle. 


Gravity is weak, but it reaches across vast distances and always pulls things together, so its power accumulates. It tends to make the universe more clumpy. Electromagnetic energy comes in negative and positive forms, so it often cancels itself out. Gravity, though puny, shapes the universe on a large scale. But electromagnetism dominates at the level of chemistry and biology, so it’s what holds our


Gravity is weak, but it reaches across vast distances and always pulls things together, so its power accumulates. It tends to make the universe more clumpy. Electromagnetic energy comes in negative and positive forms, so it often cancels itself out. Gravity, though puny, shapes the universe on a large scale. But electromagnetism dominates at the level of chemistry and biology, so it’s what holds our bodies together. The third and fourth fundamental forces are known, unexcitingly, as the strong and weak nuclear forces. They reach over tiny distances, so they matter on a subatomic scale. We humans don’t experience them directly, but they shape every aspect of our world because they determine what happens deep inside atoms.


antigravity that is present in all of space, so its power increases as the universe expands. Today, the mass of this energy may account for as much as 70 percent of the total mass of the universe.


matter is really a highly compressed form of energy.


formula—energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared, or E = mc2—tells us how much energy is compressed inside a given amount of matter.


= mc2—tells us how much energy is compressed inside a given amount of matter.


= mc2—tells us how much energy is compressed inside a given amount of matter.


The first law of thermodynamics tells us that the ocean of energy is always there; it’s conserved. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that all the forms that emerge will eventually dissolve back into the ocean of energy. The forms, like the movements of a dance, are not conserved.

there will be gravity in this universe, and electromagnetism as well, and electromagnetism is going to be 1036 times as strong as gravity.” (That really is the ratio of the strength of gravity and electromagnetism, at least in our universe.) The existence of these rules ensured that our universe would never be totally chaotic.


heat is really a measure of the motion of atoms. All particles of matter are constantly jiggling about with energy, like nervous children, and temperature is a measure of the average degree of jiggling. The jiggling is real. In a famous paper published in 1905, Einstein showed that the jiggling of atoms causes the random gyrations of dust particles in the air.


If an object, such as a motorbike, is making a noise and moving toward you, the frequency of the sound waves will seem to increase, and your ears will interpret the higher frequency as a higher pitch. After it passes you, the pitch will seem to drop, because now the waves are being stretched out. The rider, of course, is not moving relative to the motorbike and keeps hearing the same pitch. The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency of electromagnetic emissions


the amount of light from a star diminishes by the square of the distance through which it travels. This


In other words, the more distant an object was, the faster it was moving away.

as quantum physics allows things to appear from a vacuum, it seems that the entire universe really did pop out of a sort of nothingness full of potential.14


Structured flows of energy are known as free energy, and unstructured flows are known as heat energy. The difference is not absolute.


1 If you wanted to, you could direct this flow of free energy through a turbine and generate electricity. Free energy is what gets things done. It’s

When the water from a waterfall smashes into rocks at the bottom, it turns into the scattered, incoherent energy of heat. Every molecule jiggles around more or less independently. The energy is still there; it’s still conserved (that’s the first law). But the molecules push in so many directions that their energy can no longer drive a turbine. Free energy has turned into heat energy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that, in the very long run, all free energy will turn into heat energy.


Newton saw gravity as a universal force of attraction that operated between all masses. Two and a half centuries later, Einstein showed that energy could also exert a gravitational pull, because energy is what matter is made from.


On Earth, each LIGO machine split beams of light in two and sent them traveling at right angles to each other up and down two four-kilometer tubes with mirrors at either end. When they returned after almost three hundred trips, they didn’t arrive at exactly the same time. Tiny gravitational waves had stretched the tubes in one direction and shrunk them in the other by a distance much less than the width of a proton.
