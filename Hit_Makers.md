the architecture of the human mind is ancient, and the most basic human needs—to belong, to escape, to aspire, to understand, to be understood—are eternal.


The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises.


Content might be king, but distribution is the kingdom.


Television once freed “moving images” from the clutches of the cineplex; in the historical sequel, mobile technology is emancipating video from the living room.


Facebook, Twitter, and digital publishers have tools that tell them not only what story you click on, but also how far you read and where you click next.


Italo Calvino’s book Invisible Cities. It is an ode to complexity. Kublai Khan asks if there is a single stone that supports a bridge.


Italo Calvino’s book Invisible Cities. It is an ode to complexity. Kublai Khan asks if there is a single stone that supports a bridge. Marco Polo responds that a bridge stands not because of one solitary rock, but because of an arch drawn through many stones.


Borges describes an empire with a cartography guild so advanced that it designs a life-size map. Yet the people reject this achievement of exactitude, and the map’s tatters ultimately serve to clothe beggars in the desert. There is virtue in simplicity. A paper map that is the exact size of the empire it describes is “Useless,” because a map is only of service if it is small enough for somebody to hold and read it. The world is complex. But all meaning comes from wise simplification.


At the end of the second course, Cutting asked the 151 students to choose their favorite paintings among fifty-one pairs. The results of the popularity contest turned the canon upside down. In forty-one of fifty-one pairs, the students’ preference for the most famous impressionist works disappeared. The emerald magnetism of Monet’s gardens, the electric polychrome of Renoir, and the genius of Manet were nearly nullified by something else—the power of repeated exposure.


Caillebotte is the least known of the French impressionists. But it’s not because he’s the worst. It’s because he offered his friends a gift that he was willing to withhold from himself: the gift of exposure.


Birkhoff went so far as to propose a formula for writing poetry: O = aa + 2r + 2m − 2ae − 2ce.2 (It is unlikely that any person has ever used the formula to write a poem worth reading.)


Losing oneself to wonder is the opposite of brainlessness. Pleasure is a kind of thinking.


The human face is slightly asymmetric, which means that a photograph captures a slightly different face than a mirror. People sometimes wince when they see photographs of themselves, and several studies show people prefer the face that they glimpse in a reflection.


People are born average and die unique.


There is some evidence that onlookers from various backgrounds and cultures are attracted to mountains divided by snaking rivers and forests cut by trails that slink away toward a vanishing point. These details signify something human ancestors would have loved to see: a navigable path through the chaos of nature.


beauty does not reside in forms, or cosmic ratios, or even in the standard-issue wiring of humans’ minds, hearts, and guts. It exists in the interplay between the world and people—which is to say, in life. People adapt. To paraphrase Tennyson, they are the sum of all they have met. They are born average and die unique.


Union Square nicknamed “Tin Pan Alley” developed an elaborate process of plugging new music. They would pass out song sheets to local musicians, who would play each tune in different neighborhoods, from the Lower East Side to the Upper West, and report back on which songs clicked.


Beyond a certain level of songwriting genius, how many times audiences have heard a melody matters more for its popularity than how inherently catchy it is.


When consumers don’t know the true value of the products they’re looking for, they rely on corporate iconography to guide them. But when they can figure out the absolute value of a product on their own, they ignore advertisements and brands. That’s why Simonson and Rosen have named their theory “absolute value.” The


The gatekeepers had their day. Now there are simply too many gates to keep.


Critique of Judgment, Immanuel Kant proposed that pleasure can arise from a “free play” of the mind. When a person discovers an attractive idea or story, it triggers a dialogue between imagination and understanding, each quickening the other.


Thus, familiarity, fluency, and fact are inextricably linked.


There is a play-it-at-home game to explain this effect. Follow these four steps: Think of the last movie, play, or TV show that you finished: Whisper it to yourself. Between 1 (awful) and 10 (perfect), imagine how you might rate it. Now think of seven specific things you liked about the movie or show. Count them on your fingers and don’t stop until you hit seven. Finalize your rating of the show. This sort of game is famous because something curious often happens: Between steps 2 and 4, the rating typically goes down. Why should one’s opinion of a show decline as you think of more reasons to like it? After a few easy examples come to mind, the effort to dig out more examples becomes

People experience disfluency. And sometimes, they misattribute the feeling of disfluency to the quality of the show itself. This is the “less is more” or “less is better” effect. It means that less thinking leads to more liking. A cheeky UK experiment found that British students’ opinion of former prime minister Tony Blair sank as they listed more of his good qualities. Spouses offer higher appraisals of their partners when asked to name fewer charming characteristics. When something becomes hard to think about, people transfer the discomfort of the thought to the object of their thinking. Almost every piece of media people consume, every purchase they make, every design they confront lives on a continuum between fluency and disfluency—ease of thinking and difficulty of thinking. Most people lead lives of quiet fluency. They listen to music that sounds like the music they’ve already heard. They look forward to movies with characters, actors, and plots that they recognize. They don’t heed political ideas from opposing parties, particularly if these ideas also seem painfully complicated. As we’ll see in the next chapter, this is a shame, because the greatest joys often come from discovering fluency in places you didn’t expect. Fluency’s attraction is obvious. But there is a quieter truth: People need a bit of its opposite. They want to be challenged, shocked, scandalized, forced to think—just a bit. They enjoy what Kant called free play—not just a monologue of fluency, but a dialogue between “I get it” and “I don’t” and “I want to know more.” People are complicated: curious and conservative, hungry for new things and biased toward the familiar. Familiarity is not the end. It’s just the beginning. This


because the greatest joys often come from discovering fluency in places you didn’t expect.


How do you make something new, if most people just like what they know? Is it possible to surprise with familiarity?


MAYA.


MAYA. People gravitate to products that are bold, yet instantly comprehensible—“Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”


Technology enabled choices and choices created fashion—that perpetual hype cycle where designs and colors and behaviors appear suddenly cool and then suddenly anachronistic.


Hekkert’s grand theory begins with two competing pressures. On the one hand, humans seek familiarity, because it makes them feel safe. On the other hand, people are charged by the thrill of a challenge, powered by a pioneer lust.


Loewy was an excellent teacher of consumer preferences in part because he was an obsessive student of consumer habits. He piggybacked off people’s behavior rather than design products that would force them to change their lives.


MAYA theory—Most Advanced Yet Acceptable—spoke


MAYA theory—Most Advanced Yet Acceptable—spoke to the tension between people’s interest in being surprised and feeling comforted. “The consumer is influenced in his choice of styling by two opposing factors: (a) attraction to the new and (b) resistance to the unfamiliar,” he wrote. “When resistance to the unfamiliar reaches the threshold of a shock-zone and resistance to buying sets in, the design in question has reached its MAYA stage: Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.”


Loewy understood that attention doesn’t just pull in one direction. Instead, it is a tug-of-war between the opposing forces of neophilia versus neophobia,


one of the most powerful forces in popularity is the power of exposure. Exposure breeds familiarity, familiarity breeds fluency, and fluency often breeds liking. But there is such a thing as too much familiarity. It’s everywhere, in fact. It’s hearing a catchy song for the tenth time in a row, watching a movie that is oh so predictably uncreative, or hearing a talented speaker use overfamiliar buzzword after buzzword. In fluency studies, the power of familiarity is discounted when people realize that the moderator is trying to browbeat them with the same stimulus again and again. This is one reason why so much advertising doesn’t work: People have a built-in resistance to marketing that feels like it’s trying to seduce them.


Many people will put themselves through quite a bit of disfluent anguish if they expect fluent resolution at the end.


Max Planck, the theoretical physicist who helped lay the groundwork for quantum theory, said: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”


The most novel proposals got the worst ratings. “Everyone dislikes novelty,” lead author Karim Lakhani explained to me, and “experts tend to be overcritical of proposals in their own domain.” Extremely familiar proposals fared a little bit better, but they also received lower scores. The highest evaluation scores went to submissions that were deemed slightly new. There is an “optimal newness” for ideas, Lakhani said—advanced yet acceptable. The graph of optimal newness looks like this:


entrepreneur, the difference between a brilliant new idea with bad marketing and a mediocre idea with excellent marketing can be the difference between bankruptcy and success. The trick is learning to frame your new ideas as tweaks of old ideas, to mix a little fluency with a little disfluency—to make your audience see the familiarity behind the surprise.

ESPN had lost a sense of its core, Skipper told the company’s leaders at one of the first executive meetings. Rather than being great at serving one perfect product, like a steakhouse, it had become a network that served lots of mediocre fare, like a cheap diner.


These listeners want to be surprised—that’s why they play the radio rather than a CD or playlist—but they want to be surprised by the feeling of familiarity.


In an average week, ESPN delivers more than seven hundred million alerts to tens of millions of phones.


On Reddit, each piece of content is two parts: a headline and an article link. Users can promote links with “upvotes” or register their dissatisfaction with “downvotes.” Several years ago, a team of computer science researchers at Stanford University submitted and resubmitted thousands of images to Reddit with different headlines and controlled for network effects to see if the Reddit community had a clear preference for certain titles. They wanted to understand a question that I think about all the time: What makes a great headline?


Meanwhile, these Stanford computer scientists were putting empirical meat on the bare bones of my headline writing theories. They concluded that the most successful headlines on Reddit presented novel images or stories while “[conforming] to the linguistic norms of the community to which it is submitted.” A good headline, they said, is not overly familiar, but rather familiar enough; a welcome surprise expressed in the vernacular of its intended audience; a promise to advance understanding in a broadly acceptable subject—MAYA.


With more than eighty-one million listeners and twenty-one billion hours of played music each year, Pandora is the most popular digital radio app in the world. Name the bands you like, and Pandora builds a radio station around their sound. If I say I like the Beatles, Pandora will play the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, and newer bands with a Beatlesy vibe. Users can make the station better by signaling the songs they love or by skipping the songs they don’t.


“The dream of the alert industrial designer would be to design for teen-agers . . . Whether or not they fall periodically for some silly fad that does harm to no one, their basic taste remains fundamentally correct.”


Each week, Spotify bots hunt through several billion playlists from users around the world to see what songs are typically grouped together. Imagine that Song A, Song B, and Song C often appear together in the same playlist. If I often listen to Songs A and C, Spotify guesses that I’ll probably like Song B—even if I’ve never heard of its band. This way of predicting tastes by aggregating millions of people’s preferences is known as “collaborative filtering”—collaborative


“It turns out having a bit of familiarity bred trust, especially for first-time users. If we make a new playlist for you and there’s not a single thing for you to hook onto or recognize, to go, ‘Oh yeah, that’s a good call!’ it’s completely intimidating and people don’t engage.”


MAYA offers three clear lessons.


First: Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do.


Second: To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising, make it familiar.


The central insight of MAYA is that people actually prefer complexity—up to the point that they stop understanding something.


Third: People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love

If pop music were a global technology, Sweden would be its Silicon Valley. Sweden and Swedish expats are the world’s inexhaustible fount of catchy melodies.


Deutsch is a detective of musical illusions. Her most famous discovery is the phenomenon witnessed in Mr. Boyer’s music class. It is the “speech-to-song illusion.” If you take a spoken phrase and repeat it at a common interval, the spoken words can evolve to sound like music.

If it’s true that audiences like repetition, and it’s true that audiences can be bored by too much repetition, how do you get people hooked without making them habituated?


Running up and down your arms, just beneath the surface of your skin, amid the veins, glands, arteries, vessels, and nerves, there is a smooth thin muscle gripping the bottom of each hair. It is called the arrector pili muscle, and it is activated by the sympathetic nervous system. This means you cannot control it, or flex it impressively on cue, like a bicep.

After most people are in their twenties or thirties, the soft clay of taste and ideology has hardened.


When people say “history” they tend to mean something that really happened, and when they say “story” they mean something made up. But the word “story” comes from the Latin historia. History is always a story, a narrative that provides both the benefits of fictional tales—temporal connectedness, a satisfying cause-and-effect plot, and drama with meaning—and their downsides.


There is a dark side to fluency—for both makers and consumers. When creative people are too familiar with their own projects, it hurts their ability to evaluate them.

Being too familiar with my own writing makes it impossible to be an assiduous judge of its quality. I am my own best editor only when I take enough time away from my work to read it with fresh perspective.


It is precisely because great narratives seduce us that the best stories deserve the greatest skepticism.

Fashion is governed by a neophilic rule with a neophobic catch: New is good and old is bad (but very old is good again). There is a theoretical benchmark for how fashionable attitudes are shaped by the passage of time called Laver’s law, named after its originator, James Laver, a British fashion historian. It goes like this:


Distribution is a strategy to make a good product popular, but it’s not a reliable way to make a bad product seem good.


It was the ancient Greeks who finally introduced the concept of a vowel, which unlocked something previously impossible: The ability of anybody to pronounce any series of sounds by deciphering scribbles.


In 1635, the Royal Mail in Britain was made available to recipients who could pay the postage, marking Europe’s first public mail service. Two centuries later, a painter named Samuel Morse received a letter by mail that notified him of his wife’s tragic death. He immediately left Washington. But by the time he arrived in New Haven, she had already been buried. This reportedly inspired him to invent a faster mode of communication—the telegraph. Morse sent his first long-distance message in 1844, from Baltimore to Washington. Alexander Graham Bell placed the first phone call thirty-two years later.


Let’s pause here to acknowledge that, by 1900, humans had existed for two hundred thousand years and communication was still, in many ways, an ancient custom, just as first names were until the 1800s. People talked. Sometimes they sang. People read books, mostly religious texts. Some families wrote letters, and news might be transmitted by telegraph. But even the telephone seemed like a curious intrusion into the tradition of talking, and Americans appeared to have no idea what to do with it for years. It took less than ten years for cars, radios, color TVs, VCRs, cell phones, or the Internet to go from niche to mainstream—10 percent to 50 percent penetration—in the United States. It took the telephone almost forty years to make the same journey to the center of the mainstream.


If you think Tinder and dating apps are destroying romance today, you would have hated cars in the 1900s. Cars didn’t just hasten a historical shift from teenage codependence to independence.


It is precisely because they have so little to lose from the way things are that young people will continue to be the inexhaustibly neophilic motor of culture.


“information cascades.” A cascade is the map of an idea catching on.


You can flip a coin until your fingers are numb, and the share of heads and tails will eventually approach fifty-fifty. But life is one giant roulette wheel that only spins around once for each person.


chaos of life is a chronic condition for which stories are the remedy.


“Rock Around the Clock” is a story of great songwriting, the broadcast power of film, and the crucible of 1950s teenage culture. But it is also a story of mind-boggling luck. Every person who listens to “Rock Around the Clock” hears the same notes, words, and syncopation. Audiences in 1954 heard a forgettable song. Audiences in 1955 heard the hit of the century. One song, two slightly different broadcasts, two extremely different outcomes. Sounds like a tune that a chaos theorist might sing.


Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist, is credited with discovering that income within a country follows a “power law,” such that 80 percent of wealth is held by 20 percent of the population. This Pareto principle has been extended to mean that 80 percent of sales often comes from 20 percent of products. In the movie sample De Vany studied, one fifth of the movies took four fifths of the box office. In book publishing, more like 90 percent of revenues come from about 10 percent of books. In digital markets, it’s even worse: 60 percent of all app store revenue comes from just 0.005 percent of companies. For hit makers, the vast majority of bets are failures. The difference between a great year and a terrible year in publishing might come down to a tiny minority of deals.


Live by the long ball, die by the long ball. Sooner or later, chaos wins.


So when you think about Haley, you should consider his surpassingly lucky break. But if you can hold it in your head next to Einstein, Pareto, and probabilities, think of this, too: a half-blind kid who taught himself guitar, followed his cowboy-western dreams through a thousand failed experiments just to get his turn inside a Masonic temple on April 12, 1954. And there, with just one shot to sing the melody that sold forty million records, he summoned his tired voice and counted up from “one.”


“Everything in the world is about sex, except sex,” Oscar Wilde said. “Sex is about power.”


Why do individuals like what they like? But the last few chapters have shown that this question alone is insufficient. People don’t make decisions individually. They aren’t just creatures of influence (“I bought it because it’s popular”). They’re also creatures of self-expression (“I bought it because it’s me”). People


One of the hallmarks of a cult is that members unite to oppose what they see as an oppressive or illegitimate mainstream culture. But if you recall from an earlier chapter, rejecting an illegitimate norm is precisely the sociological definition of being “cool.” So what’s the difference between what people consider “cultish” versus “cool”? Both groups self-organize around the idea that the world doesn’t get them. Both develop customs that belong to them exclusively. Perhaps a cult is an extreme version of homophily. But in a way, every social network is a soft cult—a place where people can, ironically, feel like individuals by belonging to a group.


First, people seek out others who are like them. Sociologists call this “sorting.”


First, people seek out others who are like them. Sociologists call this “sorting.” Second, individuals change to become more like the group around them. This is called “socializing.”


A 2012 Harvard study found that people use about one third of personal conversations to talk about themselves. Online, that number jumps to 80 percent. A person’s egoism quotient more than doubles when she opens a computer or lock screen. Look back at the Facebook article list: Nine of the ten stories have the words “you” or “your,” which, to each reader, mean “me” and “mine.”


The researchers provided each participant with details from an imaginary day, with several happy events (like joining a friend to see a great new movie) and some bummers (having an unappetizing dessert at a local bakery). They asked participants to document the day in a note, which was meant for one friend or a larger group. People were more forthright about the bad stuff in their lives when they thought they were addressing one person. When they thought they were addressing a larger group, they airbrushed their stories for dazzling happiness.

But it is an economic fact that predicting the future is most valuable when everybody thinks you’re wrong.


Imitating recent successes is a game that everybody knows how to play. But seeing the next big thing before anybody else sees it is far more valuable. It’s Buffett in 1990. It’s Murdoch in 2001. It’s Apple in 2007. It means being a little bit wrong at just the right time.


But perhaps another lesson is about the rewards of betting on talent over outcomes, or “people over products.”


When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

The distinction between surveys, a measure of the present, and polls, a measure of the future, points to the second lesson of Gallup’s Iowa Method. People are good at telling you their feelings. But they’re less dependable at reporting their habits (particularly their bad habits) or projecting their future wants and needs.

But there’s another way to conceptualize this scheme: Gyms are monetizing the gap between aspiration and behavior.

decision-making model that he called OODA. The acronym stood for Observation, Orientation, Decision, and Action. It described a strategic approach in which information was constantly funneled back to the decision maker to construct a new theory of attack.


most successful warriors—or publishers, politicians, or sports coaches—aren’t necessarily the biggest and the strongest. Rather, a special few have the gift of perception and keen reactivity. They can size up an opponent, attack, absorb the meaning of the response, and gradually learn to anticipate the next move. On this point, Hamlet was brief, for once: “The readiness is all.”

ABC had made the park possible, but several years after it opened, the network sold its stake back to Disney. In retrospect, this was a horrifyingly bad idea, not unlike selling a band of rebels the weapons they’ll eventually use to sack your city. In 1995, the Walt Disney Company bought ABC for $19 billion, with many thanks to the profits from the very amusement park business that ABC had once financed.

Gallup’s method is best described as ethnography, and yet the field is often called “applied anthropology.” What’s the difference? Anthropology is the study of people and their environment. Ethnography is a method of studying people in their environment by observing them firsthand. Anthropology is a broad discipline, and ethnography is a specific method.
