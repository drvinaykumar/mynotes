The very word “robot” means “worker” in Czech.


Christopher Morley


According to legend, it was while lazing in bed and staring at a fly on the ceiling that Descartes, habitually a late riser, conceived of the “X” and “Y” axes that comprise the coordinate grid, now the bane of so many grade-schoolers who lose sleep studying its properties.


But it turns out that the brain is not just sitting there waiting for the next stimulation. Rather, the brain is perpetually and spontaneously active. It is maintaining, interpreting, responding, and predicting.


Amazon, I counted over ninety-five thousand books on time management. You would need to be very skilled at time management to read all of the time management books on Amazon. Assuming the average length of a book is two hundred pages, that’s nineteen million pages of time management material to read. You would have to read about three time management books a day for seventy-two years to get through them all.


Does it seem odd that as the time management industry sells more books, the number of hours we work increases? To quote Bertrand Russell, “can anything more insane be imagined?”


You can only waste time relative to some context or goal. While you are reading this book, you are wasting time relative to your goal of getting to the store before you have to pick up your kids. In fact, from some perspective, you are always wasting time.


Once we correct certain errors in our beliefs about our brains, our overworked society will appear to future generations as ridiculous and appalling.


apes are known to be proficient tool users, but they only seem to use the tools in their immediate vicinity. Chimpanzees often use nearby twigs to lure ants out of a colony. But no chimpanzees have been seen to carry a twig for miles, knowing that they might get hungry later and there might be an ant colony along the way.


So, somehow our brains seem to violate the second law of thermodynamics which states that left unattended, things in general get messy and lose heat. This is called entropy. It’s why your kitchen just gets messier and messier the longer you don’t clean it. However, the old adage that “the dishes don’t do themselves” does not apply to the brain.


Yet we feel obliged to risk our long-term health in order to work extremely hard at jobs we don’t particularly enjoy in order to buy things we don’t particularly want. This is otherwise known as free-market capitalism.


Few people fear being overweight as much as they fear terrorism, even though statistically being obese is much more of a threat to your life than terrorism.


This is called memory consolidation. It is especially important when you are learning new ideas or skills. So the best thing to do after learning new information is to take nap, or at least be idle.


What we do know now is that brain plasticity is possible throughout our lifespan. So it truly is never too late to learn a new instrument, to learn a new language, or to radically change your life: your brain will change, too.


It follows that a lifetime of being super-productive and pointlessly-busy might also decrease the functional connectivity in your default mode network.


Marcus Raichle


One of the best ways to get to know yourself is to find a quiet or comfortably noisy place, stare at the sky, space out for a while and see what the precuneous gets up to.


in males, the prefrontal cortex does not finish maturing until about age twenty-five. I mentioned above that the prefrontal cortex is responsible for skills like decision making, planning, impulsecontrol, and self-reflection—skills that many males under twenty-five tend to lack.


Newton was in fact known for his obsessive work ethic. He could sit in his garden and do nothing because it would never have occurred to Newton that sitting in his garden contemplating was the same thing as wasting time.


A “Newton” is an indispensible unit of measurement that tells you how much force you need to move a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared.


When children enter school, and increasingly even before they enter school, parents fill up their lives with a stream of activities: sports, early exposure music classes, Chinese immersion school, summer camps, volunteer soup kitchen duties, dressage lessons, theater coaching, mathletics, and science workshops. There seems to be a pervasive and deep-seated anxiety among a certain class of parents that their children might actually have time to hang around and be children. Parents are forced to work longer and longer hours, sometimes just to keep the same pay. To replace ourselves we force our children to endure an endless barrage of activities that serve as proxy parents. We do this in order to convince ourselves that we still participate in some meaningful way in our children’s lives.

After all, we have more important things to do, like work!


there are apparently plenty of academicdoping doctors who will prescribe ADHD medicine to undiagnosed students so they can attain artificial laser-like focus and crush their competition on the SATs.


This, despite the fact that IQs have been rising. After analyzing the data from around three hundred thousand children and adults, Kyng Hee Kim, a researcher at William & Mary, found that this decline in creativity is most pronounced in exactly the age group from which you’d expect the most creativity, kindergarten through sixth grade.


First childhood, no limits, no renunciations, no goals. Such unthinking joy.
Then abruptly terror, schoolrooms, boundaries, captivity, and a plunge into temptation and deep loss.


For example, research indicates that young people who send text messages extremely often tend to score lower on tests that measure moral reflectivity. This could be because with each new text, the task positive network is engaged, thereby suppressing activity in the default mode network. We start to identify more with the phone in our pockets than the mind in our heads.


students who actually have interests outside of padding their resumes are quite rare. Students are worried about having to “explain away” gaps on their resumes.


“… I soon understood that in serious work commanding and discipline are of little avail.”
—Peter Kropotkin


In nature, adaptive self-organization is the rule rather than the exception.


we should instead use the brain’s self-organized behavior as a model to argue against imposing external organization on your life, since this more accurately reflects the brain’s composition and dynamics.


The number of ants alive at any given time has been estimated to be around ten million billion. And given that a human weighs approximately one to two million times as much as an ant, ants and humans have roughly the same global biomass.


Ant colonies are capable of very complicated behavior. For instance, ant colonies can learn. A colony quickly finds the best route to a food source, the best place to dispose of dead ants, and even learns to regulate the internal temperature of a nest. Yet each ant has a very tiny brain. An individual ant has no idea what it is doing. How does the extremely organized complex 8 1  behavior of ant colonies arise out of millions of dumb ants each doing their own thing? Especially given that an ant colony has no command and control structure. An individual ant follows a set of very simple rules when going about its daily business, based on whether he’s a worker, a drone, or a soldier.


Adaptive knowledge and information can be processed by the colony, but not by individual ants. Therefore, there are certain attributes of the colony that no individual ant has.


Consider a football team: the team has properties that each player does not, one of which is being a football team made of eleven players. Certain behaviors are only visible at the colony level of description.

an ant colony can learn the best route to a food source, can build enormous networks of tunnels and nests, and can even grow fungus in complicated underground gardens.


In computer science, there is a famous cellular automata model called Langton’s ant. Imagine an ant called Langton randomly walking around on a grid made of black or white squares. Langton only has two rules: (1) when he lands on a white square he turns 90 degrees to the right, flips the color of the square to black and moves forward one square, (2) when he lands on a black square he turns 90 degrees to the left, flips the square to white and moves forward one unit. No matter how you set up the grid initially, no matter what arrangement of black and white squares you use as an initial configuration, after about ten thousand steps, Langton will start making a repetitive “highway” pattern of one hundred and four steps for infinity. In other words, no matter how he starts off, Langton will converge on this complex pattern. This is only one ant, using only two rules. Langton provides insight as to how the behavior of ant colonies can be so spectacular in the real world.


the individual neurons in our brains do not in themselves know that they are part of your brain, or that they make up “you.” Your consciousness is very much like the army ant’s bivouac. One of the persistent philosophical illusions we’ve had for centuries is that there is some place in our brain where a little person named Homunculus controls the actions of our brains.


“Specialization is for insects.” 
—Bart Kosko, professor, USC; author of Noise


Human beings are actually terrible at specialization. This is why every attempt to turn human beings into worker insects for the benefit of rich people results in massive human misery.

Working nonstop has become a new badge of honor among the professional digital class. We walk around with our gadgets trying to define our value propositions. The compulsion that businesses have to organize our lives with apps and calendars comes from deep ignorance of how the brain actually functions.


Albert Einstein, in a much-overlooked 1949 essay called “Why Socialism?”, wrote, “If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. As mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change.”


It is our heart’s ability to flexibly respond to changes in activity that prevents stroke or heart attack. Reduced heart rate variability is a very good predictor of poor cardiac health.


Stress reduces the variability in our heart rate: a low level of anxiety forces the heart to be in a state of preparedness, which it cannot maintain indefinitely.


book The Signal and the Noise,


in nonlinear systems, adding a certain optimal amount of noise actually increases the signalto-noise ratio. In other words, adding noise to a faint signal might actually make the signal stronger.


We do not know at this point what the long-term effects of ADHD medication are, especially on healthy young brains. It is entirely possible that some form of adaption could occur, and less natural dopamine would be produced, which could lead to problems such as depression later in life.

Six Sigma was developed at Motorola in the early 1980s to study and control defects in semiconductor chip manufacturing—and that’s probably where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, like some contagious virus developed at a CDC lab, it escaped the factory. It has now become a horrifying corporate epidemic.


Over the last decade or so, the Six Sigma approach has come under intense criticism. Several large companies such as 3M noticed that when they religiously implemented Six Sigma, innovation slowed to a crawl.


Motorola, where the Six Sigma outbreak started, used to enjoy a huge lead in the mobile phone market. Their dominant position in the market has evaporated. The mobile marketplace is one of the fastest moving and most innovative, and it seems like forcing your opponents to adopt Six Sigma tactics is a good way to cripple them.


The only system we know of in the universe that can be innovative is the human brain. But the brain seems to need things like freedom, long periods of idleness, positive emotions, low stress, randomness, noise, and a group of friends with tea in the garden to be creative.


China has been experiencing exceptional economic growth. China has been increasing its output of goods and services at a rate of about ten percent every year. According to this measurement, every year there are ten percent more goods and services in China than the year before. Does this include things like hamburgers, massages, weddings, and drug dealers? China is also a great example of the theme of this chapter: unchecked economic growth leads to environmental disaster—even in the short term.


To the ancient Greeks, anyone who had to work to make a living was considered a slave.


Americans are being conditioned to accept their own exploitation as normal. Ridden with debt from the minute they graduate college, they compete for the privilege of working without pay.” If there is one thing worse than working for pay, it’s working without pay.
