the power of the word: words make things happen. The physical actions of ritual alone would be insufficient; it is the skillfully crafted, properly formulated hymn, the verbal portion of the ritual, that makes the liturgical acts effective.


The word for “truth” is r̥ta﻿́,


The term r̥ta﻿́ essentially defines what a being or object is and what it does, and it structures the relationships of beings and objects with other beings and objects.


adhidaivam or adhidevatam, roughly “concerned with the divine,” while the mundane is called adhyātmam, roughly “concerned with the person(al).”


adhiyajñam “relating to the sacrifice.”


Although the correspondences are not as systematically worked out and pre- sented in the R̥gveda as in those later texts, this way of thinking is just as pervasive in that text, though backgrounded: the poets assume that they share with their

Although the correspondences are not as systematically worked out and pre- sented in the R̥gveda as in those later texts, this way of thinking is just as pervasive in that text, though backgrounded: the poets assume that they share with 


rays of light at dawn are homologized to cows, as in the Vala myth discussed above, and therefore the goddess Dawn is called “the mother of cows” and images of ruddy cows overrun the hymns to Dawn.


Cows also have a ritual association: milk is mixed with the soma juice after it is pressed, and so the soma hymns are filled with depictions of the soma (as bull) running toward or mixing with “the cows,” that is, the milk. And cows are also homologized to waters, particularly the waters confined by Vr̥tra and released by Indra’s killing of that demon.


brahma﻿́n is the “formulator,” who discerns and puts into words the hidden truths that undergird reality. His product is a bra﻿́hman, a “sacred formulation.”


Āhavanīya (the fire “to be offered into”) set to the east, the Gārhapatya (“householders’ fire”) to the west, from which the Āhavanīya is taken out and carried to the east, and the Dakṣiṇāgni (“southern fire”),


puro﻿́hita “placed to the east/in front,”


The ritual became less an invitation to the gods and more a manipula- tion of them. One marker of this shift was the rise in the later Veda of Prajāpati,


This is perhaps most obviously the case for the brahma﻿́n. In the later ritual the brahma﻿́n became the formal overseer of the ritual. In the R̥gveda he was rather the poet who formulates the truth


Hotar is the priest who recites the hymns and is secondarily associated with the root √ hū “call,” his name originally meant the “pourer” (derived from the root √ hu “pour”), which indicates that his ancient function was both to pour the offerings and to recite. In the R̥gveda he was likely often the composer of the hymns he recited as well.


As we shall see, the R̥gveda attaches great importance to the names of gods. By invoking, varying, and meaningfully placing gods’ names in their verses and by echoing the sounds of those names, the poets bring about the presence of the gods,


The god is who the god is because the god obeys the truth embedded in that name. Thus the goddess Dawn is the Dawn because she adheres to the truth that she appears in the morning before the sun.


To be sure, the meanings of the names of some gods, such as Viṣṇu, the Nāsatyas, or the Maruts, are unclear or controversial, and the names of other gods, such as the Aśvins (“Horsemen”), imperfectly represent their charac- ters.


Starting with their names, we can classify gods according to their different spheres of action. This categorization will be porous, since some gods cross bound- aries of domains and functions, and will be more orderly than R̥gvedic reality, but it gives an approximate shape to the R̥gvedic pantheon. There are at least five categories of divinities. First


second category of divinity includes


Savitar, the “Impeller,” who compels humans and other living beings to action or sends them to rest.

B. deVAs And AsuRAs Beginning


An apparent mirror image of this paired opposition is found in Old Iranian in the Avestan texts, where ahura, the direct cognate of Sanskrit a﻿́sura, is the title of the head of the pantheon, Ahura Mazdā “Lord Wisdom,” and the daēuua s (exact cognate of Sanskrit deva﻿́) are the enemies of all that is good.


In his role as priest-king Indra is also called bŕ̥haspa﻿́ti, the “lord of the sacred formulation.” Br̥haspati appears not only as Indra, but also as a separate divinity alongside Indra.


Indra seems to participate in a rivalry with his father, who may be Tvaṣṭar. The unnatural birth and the rivalry with the divine father are of course well-nigh universal attributes of “the hero”;


fallow bays ( ha﻿́rī)


ta﻿́nūna﻿́pāt describes Agni as the “son of himself,” and na﻿́rāśa﻿́ṃsa as the one “who embodies men’s praise”


The Ādityas are sons of the goddess Aditi, whose name means “offenselessness” or “innocence.”


Varuṇa, whose name is related to vrata﻿́ “commandment” and who therefore is the god of commandments.


A mitra﻿́ was an ally or an alliance, and Mitra is the god of alliances.


Bhaga ensures that people will receive an appropriate portion of the goods of life.


He stretches out his arms in a gesture of command (II.38.2). Falk (1988: 17–22) reasonably suggests that his brilliance during the night and his outstretched arms point to the Milky Way as a manifestation of Savitar.


If the Milky Way is the celestial embodiment of Savitar, Sūrya, the Sun, comes close to being that of Mitra and Varuṇa. The Sun is their eye, for his gaze is wide (VII.35.8) and falls on everyone (I.50.2). The Sun watches over the good and evil deeds of humans


Since he is so closely linked to the Ādityas, he himself is called an Āditya (I.50.13, 191.9; VIII.101.11).


However, Sūrya is not associated exclusively with the Ādityas. He is a form of Agni, Agni Vaiśvānara, and the face of Agni.


Dawn is one of the few female divinities in the R̥gveda and the most prominent among them. Twenty-one hymns are dedicated to her alone


Dawn is also, not surprisingly, associated with the god Sun, Sūrya, who is often depicted as following her as her suitor or husband.


Her associations are not all positive, however. Because she heralds every new day, she reminds men of the unstoppable passage of time and of the aging process, as well as of the generations of men who used to view the dawn but have passed away.


Dawn’s daily rebirth as an ever-young beauty presents a cruel contrast to the human condition of change and decay. The poets also often reflect on the paradox that each Dawn is new but each is the same as the one before and the one that will come after.


Such characteristics show Vāyu’s close connection to the wind, even though he does not represent the wind directly.


The ordinary word for the wind is vā́ta, and unlike Vāyu, the god Vāta closely reflects the character and activity of the wind. He goes shattering and thundering, raising the dust; he moves through the midspace and is the companion of the waters. The symbolic features of Vāta likewise reflect the wind. Vāta is the breath ( ātma﻿́n) of the gods (X.168.4), and as the lifebreath, he is the father, brother, and companion of the man whom he makes live (X.186.1–3).


The Aśvins are connected with honey, ma﻿́dhu,


They are the fourth most frequently invoked deities in the R̥gveda after Indra, Agni, and Soma.


dyaúṣ pitā́ “father Heaven”


In the R̥gveda, Heaven as a divinity is generally paired with the female Earth,


They are normally grammatically joined in a dual dvandva compound ( dyā́vā-pr̥thivī́), and several hymns are dedicated to this couple.


The meaning of Tvaṣṭar’s name is fully transparent: he is the “Fashioner,” who “adorned all the creatures with their forms” (X.110.9) and who knows all living things (IV.42.3). But his role is more complex than his name might imply. He is the father of Indra


Pūṣan in several passages is said to be the husband or consort of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, who is the archetypal bride in the R̥gveda, and he is also said to be the lover of his sister and the wooer of his mother (VI.55.4–5), though this apparent incest provokes no blame. The tangled family relations thus alluded to are not treated in any detail,


therefore the god who is wide-ranging ( urugāya﻿́) and wide-striding ( urukrama﻿́).


Śiva, “the kindly one,”


on the one hand, he is fierce and malevolent, with an often inexplicable anger that needs to be appeased; on the other, he is a healer, who controls the remedies for disease. He is also, as noted above, the father of the Maruts, who are much more prominent in our text.


R̥gveda provides little or no evidence for her later role as patron of learning and the arts,


The females in these hymns are quite outspoken, usually about sex, and their male conversation partners tend to look weak and helpless in comparison.


Sanskrit is an inflectional language with an especially rich morphology, and most of the grammatical information that is carried in English by word order and by separate elements such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs is coded in Sanskrit on the word itself.


We refer the interested reader to Jamison (2004b) for a very skeletal account and to any standard Sanskrit reference grammar for more details. Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar for Students (Macdonell 1916) is admirably clear and informative, and the classic Sanskrit reference grammar is Whitney (1889).


the vocabulary they use is simply enormous relative to the size of the text: Grassmann’s lexicon of the R̥gveda is a very fat volume, with 1685 pages of lemmata—a giant word-hoard, full of rarities and hapax legomena, slang and colloquialisms.


R̥gveda X.129 links the creativity of poets to the creation of the world.


Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron (¯). Light syllables contain a short vowel followed by, at most, a single consonant and are symbolized by a breve (˘).


a noun is indefinite (“a horse”) or definite (“the horse”),


Even the sixty-seven gāyatrī hymns to Soma Pavamāna that occupy the first half of the IXth Maṇḍala and are extremely narrowly focused on a very few steps of ritual procedure manage an astounding amount of variety within these metrical and topical limits. In fact, they might serve as a textbook of how a R̥gvedic poet deploys his skills to produce multiple, very different versions of a simple and single message.


Agni is “placed to the fore” (vs. 1) because the principal fire of the sacrifice is placed in the east of the sacrificial area


The actual content of the two hymns is quite simple. In I.2 the first two tr̥cas to Vāyu and Indra and Vāyu respectively announce that the soma has been pressed and urge the gods to come to our sacrifice. The tr̥ca to Mitra and Varuṇa is slightly more interesting, in that it mentions the frequently conjoined notions of “insight” I.3 91 ( dhī́), “skill” ( da﻿́kṣa), and “resolve” or “purpose” ( kra﻿́tu), the three elements necessary to conceive and carry out an action.


feature of the hymn is an instance of the famous, but relatively rare, formula “imperishable fame” ( śra﻿́vaḥ. . . a﻿́kṣitam) in verse 7, where the two words are found in separate pādas (b and


3. O you of the lovely lips who govern all domains, reach exhilaration through the exhilarating praise songs here at these soma-pressings.


Agni we choose as messenger, the Hotar affording all possessions, very effective for this sacrifice.


Agni after Agni they always invoke with invocations as the clanlord, conveyor of the oblations, dear to many.


O shining one whose oblation is ghee, burn against those who do harm, o Agni, against demonic beings.


By Agni is Agni kindled—poet, houselord, youth, conveying the oblation, with the sacrificial ladle in his mouth.


The lord of the oblation who honors you as his messenger, o god Agni, for him become a helper.


Agni, with your blazing flame, along with all the invocations to the gods, enjoy this praise of ours right now!


Agni, with your blazing flame, along with all the invocations to the gods, enjoy this praise of ours right now! I.13

I.13 Āprı ̄ Medhātithi Kāṇva


Well-kindled, o Agni, convey the gods here to us, to the man offering the oblation, and perform sacrifice, o pure Hotar.


The two well-tongued poets, the Divine Hotars, I invite. Let them perform this sacrifice for us right here. 9. Iḍā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, the three goddesses who are joy itself— let them sit, unfailing, on the ritual grass.


2. He who is rich, who smashes afflictions, while finding goods and increasing prosperity, let him accompany us, he who is powerful. 3. Let not the (male)diction, the malice of the grudging mortal reach us. Guard us, Lord of the Sacred Formulation.


5. Those who through truth increase by truth, the lords of truth, of light, these two, Mitra and Varuṇa, do I call.


19. Within the waters is deathlessness, in the waters healing, and (it is right) to glorify the waters. O gods, become prizewinners. 20. “Within the waters,” Soma said to me, “are all healing remedies, and Agni who is weal to all.” And the waters are healing for 


21. O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my body and (for me) to see the sun for a long time. 22. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me— whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth. 23. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap. Full of milk, come here, o Agni. Merge me with luster.


I.24 Agni, Savitar, and Varuṇa Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti


Aditi, the goddess who represents Innocence or Guiltlessness,


Both Savitar and Bhaga are Ādityas, so the poet is still moving toward Varuṇa, the greatest of the Ādityas.


A hundred healers are yours, o king, a thousand. Let your favor be broad and deep. Drive dissolution far away into the distance. Release from us even the guilt we have created.


Varuṇa’s glory is “right here within our bellies.” We understand the presence of Varuṇa’s glory in the belly as signifying the


radical closeness of Varuṇa, but there are other ways of interpreting it. The reference to “bellies” has led Geldner, for example, to understand this as a healing hymn for dropsy, a disease associated with Varuṇa.


1. Put on your garments, you partaker of the sacrificial meal and lord of nourishments, and so perform this rite for us. 2. Take your seat as our Hotar, worthy to be chosen by our thoughts and heaven-bound speech, o youngest Agni. 3. For a father always sacrifices on behalf of his son, a friend on behalf of his friend, a comrade worth choosing on behalf of his comrade. I.27 125 4. Let Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, who care for the stranger, take their seats here on our ritual grass, as if (on that) of Manu. 5. O ancient Hotar, rejoice in this (ritual grass) and in our comradeship; listen well to these songs here. 6. For even when we sacrifice to god after god in unbroken succession, it is just in you that the oblation is poured. 7. Let him be our dear clanlord—the delighting Hotar worthy to be chosen; let us be dear (to him) and (so) possess good fires. 8. Since the gods have good Agni (among them) and established him as a choice thing for us, we consider ourselves to possess good fires [/Agni]. 9. So then, of us both, mortals (and immortals), o immortal one, let there be encomia each for the other. 10. O Agni, along with all the fires, take delight in this sacrifice and in this speech, o young (son) of strength.


Both from afar and from nearby, from the mortal who wishes ill protect us always, you who last a whole lifetime.


You are the apportioner, o bright-beamed one. (As if) on the wave of a river, in the nearness and all at once you stream for the pious man.


The mortal whom you will help in battles, o Agni, whom you will spur on to the prizes, he will hold fast to unfailing refreshments.


Let him who is great without measure, much glittering but possessing a beacon of smoke, urge us on to insight and to the prize.


Reverence to the great ones and reverence to the small; reverence to the young and reverence to those advanced (in years). Let us offer sacrifice to the gods if we will be able. Let me not twist away the laud for one more powerful in my direction, o gods.


I.28 Indra (1–4), the Mortar (5–6), the Mortar and Pestle (7–8),


You, Agni, are (fatherly) solicitude, you a father to us. You are creator of vitality; we are your kin. Riches in hundreds, in thousands converge on you, the well-heroed protector of the commandment, o undeceivable one.

Notes: 1) evening chants for savitar 


There are three heavens: two are the laps of Savitar, one is the hero-vanquishing one in the world of Yama. Like a chariot (wheel) on the axle-pin, the (creatures) have taken their place on his immortal (foundations?).—Whoever will perceive this, let him declare it here.


6. Just in you who bring good fortune is every oblation poured, o youngest Agni. Benevolent toward us today and in the future, sacrifice to the gods for masses of good heroes.


Sit together (with us): you are great. Blaze as the best at pursuing the gods. Let loose your beautiful red smoke in every direction, o lauded Agni, partaker of the ritual 


Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar, upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with their ornaments in invoking (you).


Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar, upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with their ornaments in invoking (you). 14. Upright, protect us from narrow straits with your beacon. Burn up every devourer. Make us upright to move and to live. Find favor for us among the gods. 15. Protect us from the demon, o Agni. Protect us from the malice of the enemy. Protect from the man who does harm or who seeks to smash us, o youngest one with lofty beams. 16. As if with a deadly weapon, smash asunder our enemies and whoever deceives us, o you of scorching fangs. The mortal who sharpens himself throughout the nights, let that cheat not be master of us.


Speak here with a song at length to the Lord of the Sacred Formulation, to awaken him, and to Agni, lovely to see like an ally.


For a rival to you has not been found in heaven nor on earth, o you who care for the stranger. Yours be the might, with your full lineage as yokemate; o Rudras, let it never be open to challenge.


Just that would we speak at the rites—the faultless mantra that brings good fortune, o gods. And if you gladly receive this speech, o noble men [=gods], it will attain all things of yours worth winning.


Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman— that person is never deceived. 2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect from harm, he thrives, unharmed and whole. 3. The kings [=Ādityas] smash apart the hard places, apart the hostilities in front of them; they lead across difficult ways. 4. The path is easy to go on and harmless to men for the one going to truth. There is no fissure there for you. 5. The sacrifice that you lead along the straight path, o superior men, Ādityas, that will reach you for insight.


Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman— that person is never deceived. 2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect from harm, he thrives, unharmed and whole.


Agni, immortal one—the bright benefit radiating from Dawn: convey it here to the pious man, o Jātavedas; convey here today the gods who wake at dawn. 2. For you are the delightful messenger, conveyor of oblations, o Agni, charioteer of the ceremonies. Jointly with the Aśvins and with Dawn establish in us good heroism and lofty fame.


3. Today we choose as messenger Agni the good one, dear to many, whose beacon is smoke, but who is foamy with radiance when the dawns break, the glory of the ceremonies, of the sacrifices. 4. The fairest, the youngest guest, well-libated, delightful to the pious folk— I reverently invoke Agni Jātavedas when the dawns break, to journey to the gods. 5. I will praise you—o immortal nurturer of all— as immortal guardian—o Agni, partaker of the ritual meal—as best sacrificer—o conveyor of the oblation.


The inspired poets whose soma is pressed have roused you to delight— they bearing the lofty light, the oblation for the pious mortal, o Agni.


1. Up do the beacons convey this god Jātavedas, the Sun, for all to see.


10. Looking up from the darkness to the higher light, we have come up to the Sun, god among the gods, the highest light. 11. As you go up today, o you of Mitra’s might, and mount the higher heaven, banish my heart-affliction and jaundice, o Sun. 12.


11. As you go up today, o you of Mitra’s might, and mount the higher heaven, banish my heart-affliction and jaundice, o Sun. 12.


1. The other fires are just twigs of you, Agni. In you do all the immortals bring themselves to euphoria. Vaiśvānara, you are the navel of the settlements. Like a pillar, as prop you hold the peoples fast.


the dative asmaí “for him” or the genitive asyá “of him,”


It is difficult to do justice to this tour de force of poetic craft, and many of its finest effects have not been discussed here. It is, unfortunately, even more difficult to do justice to it in English translation.


Salute the two world-halves [= ro﻿́dasī ], you who are splendor in a flock, who accompany the superior man [=Indra], champions with a snake’s fury in your strength. She [=Rodasī], like lightning lovely to look at, has mounted your chariot like the ensign on chariot boxes, o Maruts.


As is generally the case with dvipadā virāj meter, the hymn falls into two-verse units, essentially equivalent to a single trimeter verse (forty syllables, versus forty-four [triṣṭubh] or forty-eight [jagatī]).


1. Hiding in secret like a thief with livestock, yoking homage, conveying homage: 2. (You) did the clever, of one accord, follow along your tracks; all those worthy of the sacrifice reverently approached you. 3. The gods followed the commandments of truth. Like heaven (enclosing) the earth was his enclosing. 4. With wonder the waters strengthen the lovely child, well-begotten in the lap of truth, in its womb. 5. Like thriving that brings delight, like a broad (place of) peaceful dwelling, like a mountain a source of benefit, like a gush (of water) that brings blessings; 6. Like a steed on its course, launched in a surge, like a river (sending) its gush: who can obstruct him? 7. Akin to the rivers, like a brother to his sisters, (yet,) like a king his vassals, he devours the wood. 188 I.66 8. When, sped by the wind, he has spread out through the wood, Agni cuts the hair of the earth. 9. He hisses like a wild goose sitting in the waters; awakening at dawn, he is the most conspicuous to the clans by his intention. 10. Like soma, a ritual expert, begotten of truth; ranging widely like livestock with their young, far-radiant.


Delightful like a home, he maintains peace; ripe like grain, a conqueror of peoples. 4. Having rhythm like a seer, lauded among the clans; well treated like a winning horse, he confers vitality.


4. All have a share in divinity and in its name, as they serve immortal truth in their own ways.


1. Might we vanquish the many inspired thoughts of the stranger by our inspired thought; might bright-blazing Agni attain all things (for us), 2. Watching over all the divine commandments and the races of the people descended from Manu. 3. He who is the embryo of the waters, the embryo of the woods, and the embryo of the still, the embryo of the moving, 4. Even in the rock (as well as) within the house, every immortal, like every (member) of the clans, is very attentive to him. 5. For Agni, the protector of riches on earth, does ritual service (for him [=the mortal]) who does ritual service for him [=Agni] fittingly with good hymns. 6. O watchful (Agni), protect these worlds, since you know the races of gods and of mortals. 7. Whom they will make grow through the many nights (and dawns) of differing forms— the one conceived by truth (whom) the moving and the still (will make grow), 8. He has been brought to success, installed as Hotar, as the sun, performing all the tasks to be realized. 9. You acquire a laud among the cows and the (fire)wood. All bear tribute to (you), our sun. 10. Men serve you separately in many places; they bear (you) away separately as (sons bear away) the property of their aging father. 11. Avid like (a horse) heading to the goal, like a champion archer, fearsome like a (chariot-)driver, dazzling in combats.


1. Who confers vitality like wealth acquired from one’s father, providing good guidance like the instruction of a perceptive man, resting in a comfortable place like a guest whose pleasure is served, like a Hotar he has traversed the (sacrificial) seat of him who does honor. 2. Whose thoughts become reality like god Savitar’s, who protects all communities according to his will, lauded by many like a (royal) emblem, really present and agreeable like one’s own self, he has become desirable to install. 3. Who, suckling all, dwells peacefully upon the earth, like a god, like a king with established alliances, stationed in front like heroes stationed for protection, irreproachable like a wife pleasing to her husband— 4. You, o Agni, kindled here in the house as their own, do men attend on in their fixed abodes. They deposited abundant heavenly brilliance within him. Become the foundation of riches for your whole lifetime! I.74 199 5. Might the bounteous ones reach nourishments, o Agni, and (might) the patrons who give (reach) through a whole lifetime. Might we gain the victory-prize in our clashes with the stranger, acquiring a portion among the gods for our fame. 6. For the bellowing cows of truth, apportioned by heaven, swell with their udders; from afar, seeking a portion of (your?) favor, the rivers have flowed forth all at once over the rock. 7. Seeking a portion of favor in you, those worthy of worship [=gods] set their fame in heaven. They made night and dawn of different forms, and they put together the black color and the red. 8. Might we—we and our patrons—be those mortals whom you will sweeten for wealth, o Agni. Like a shadow you accompany all creation, having filled the two world-halves and the space between. 9. Might we vanquish steeds with steeds, men with men, and heroes with heroes, o Agni, when aided by you. As lords of wealth acquired from their fathers, might our patrons, having a hundred winters, reach through (a whole lifetime). 10. Let these solemn speeches be pleasing to you, o Agni, ritual expert—to your mind and heart. Might we be able to control (the prizewinning horses) of your wealth, (so they are) amenable to the chariot-pole, while we acquire the fame apportioned by the gods.


1. Take delight in the most extensive speech, which affords most delight to the gods, while pouring the oblations into your own mouth. 2. Then, o Agni, best of Aṅgirases, best of ritual adepts, something dear to you might we speak—a winning sacred formulation. 3. Who is the kinsman of your peoples? O Agni, who holds the pious ceremony? Who are you and fixed in what? 4. You are the kinsman of the peoples. O Agni, you are the dear envoy, a comrade for your comrades, to be reverently invoked. 5. Sacrifice for us to Mitra and Varuṇa; sacrifice to the gods, to lofty truth. Agni, you will sacrifice to your own home.


1. What reverent approach is to your heart’s desire? What inspired thought will be the most beneficial, Agni? Or, who attains your skill through his sacrifices? Or, with what mind should we piously serve you? 202 I.77 2. Come hither, Agni; sit down here as Hotar. Become an undeceivable leader for us. Let the two world-halves, which set everything in motion, aid you. Sacrifice to the gods for great benevolence. 3. Burn away all demonic beings, Agni. Become for the sacrifices the protector from curses. Then convey here the lord of soma with his two fallow bays. We have made a guest reception for him who gives well. 4. With a speech bringing offspring you are to be invoked as the conveyor (of oblations) with your mouth, and you will sit down here with the gods. You pursue the Hotarship and the Potarship, you instrument of sacrifice. Become (all this), o provider and engenderer of goods. 5. Just as you sacrificed to the gods with the oblations of the inspired poet Manu, along with the poets, yourself a poet, even so, o Hotar most truly present, o Agni, today perform sacrifice with your gladdening tongue.


verb √ vī “pursue”


1. To you, o boundless Jātavedas, with a hymn do we Gotamas keep bellowing, with éclat. 2. And to you with a hymn does Gotama, desirous of wealth, show friendship. – We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat. 3. And to you, best winner of prizes, do we call, as Aṅgiras did. – We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat. 4. And to you, best smasher of obstacles, who send the Dasyus tumbling down, we keep bellowing, with éclat. 5. We Rahūgaṇas have spoken a honeyed speech to Agni. – We keep bellowing to (him), with éclat.


Through the nights in your own person, King Agni, and at the dawning of dawn, o sharp-fanged one, burn against the demons. 7. Help us, Agni, with your help at the presentation of the gāyatrī song, o you to be extolled in all hymnic visions. 8. Bring here to us wealth, o Agni, which is victorious in every way, worthy to be chosen, and difficult to surpass in all battles. 9. (Bring) here to us wealth affording lifelong prosperity with your kind attention, o Agni. Confer grace, (for us) to live.


The next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is in uṣṇih meter (8 8 12); the last four syllables of the third pāda are a semidetached refrain (“Indra indeed!”), so that the verses present themselves like gāyatrī (i.e., 8 8 8).


Although no strong unity among the various pieces of this hymn is perceptible, it does mimic in certain ways the progress of a soma sacrifice.


1. O Maruts of extensive might, certainly the man over whose dwelling place you keep protective watch from heaven, he has the best protector.


9. You whose strength is real—make it [=strength] manifest by your greatness. Smite the demon with your lightning. 10. Conceal the concealable darkness. Run over every rapacious one. Make the light that we desire.


1. Let auspicious ideas come here to us from all sides—undeceivable, uncircumscribable, bursting out— so that the gods will be (ready) to increase us always, will be our unfaltering protectors every day. 2. The auspicious benevolence of the gods is for those who aim straight; let the generosity of the gods roll down toward us. We have reverently approached the fellowship of the gods: let the gods lengthen our lifetime for us to live. 3. Them do we call upon with our age-old formal invocation [=nivid]: Bhaga, Mitra, Aditi, Skill unfailing, Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May well-portioned Sarasvatī create joy for us. 4. At this let the Wind blow us a remedy that is joy itself. At this (let) Mother Earth, at this (let) Father Heaven, 222 I.90 at this (let) the soma-pressing stones (be) joy itself. To this, o holy Aśvins, give ear. 5. The one who holds sway, the lord of the moving and the still, who quickens insight, do we call upon for help, so that Pūṣan will be (ready) to increase our possessions, will be a guardian, an undeceivable protector for our well-being. 6. Well-being for us (may) Indra of strengthened fame (establish); well-being for us (may) Pūṣan of all possessions; well-being for us (may) Tārkṣya of indestructible wheel-rims; well-being for us may Br̥haspati establish. 7. The Maruts having dappled horses, having Pr̥śni as mother, charging to beauty, coming regularly to the rites, the men having Agni as tongue and the Sun as eye: may all the gods come here to us with help. 8. Might we hear (only what is) auspicious with our ears, o gods; might we see (only what is) auspicious with our eyes, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice. Having praised (you?), with sturdy limbs and bodies might we traverse the lifetime that has been established by the gods. 9. A hundred autumns are now in front (of us), o gods, where you have made old age for our bodies, where sons become fathers. Do not harm our lifetime in the midst of our progress. 10. Aditi is heaven. Aditi is the midspace. Aditi is the mother; she is the father, she the son. Aditi is the All Gods, the five peoples. Aditi is what has been born, Aditi what is to be born.


1. With straight guidance let Varuṇa, let Mitra the knowing guide us; let Aryaman jointly with the gods. 2. For they are goods-possessors of goods; unerring, they with their mighty powers guard the commandments everywhere. 3. They will extend shelter to us, the immortals to the mortals, thrusting away hatreds. 4. Let them clear out paths for us for easy passage—Indra, the Maruts, Pūṣan, Bhaga, (all those) to be extolled. 5. And (make) our poetic insights tipped with cows, o Pūṣan and Viṣṇu traveling your ways; make us possessed of well-being. 6. Honey do the winds (blow) to the one who follows truth; honey do the rivers stream. Honeyed be the plants for us. 7. Honey by night and at dawn; honeyed is the earthly realm. Honey be Father Heaven for us. 8. Honeyed be the tree for us, honeyed the sun. Honeyed be the cows for us. 9. Luck for us Mitra, luck Varuṇa; luck be Aryaman for us— Luck for us Indra and Br̥haspati; luck for us Viṣṇu of the wide strides.


10. Being born again and again though ancient, (always) beautifying herself to the same hue, like a successful (gambler) with the best throw who diminishes the stake (of his opponent), the goddess keeps diminishing the lifetime of the mortal as she ages him.


11. Uncovering the ends of heaven, she has awakened. She keeps her sister [=Night] far away. Diminishing human (life-)spans, the maiden radiates forth with the eye of her swain [=Sun].


śruṣṭimántam “having an attentive hearing”)


The collection is at a generally high level of poetic craftsmanship, but we will only single out for special mention 104, a challenging Indra hymn, 105, a famous and enigmatic All God hymn, and the lovely Dawn hymn 113. I.94 Agni


2. For whom you perform sacrifice, that one reaches his goal. Without assault he dwells in peace; he will acquire good heroes en masse. He is powerful; constraint does not reach him. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm. 3. Might we be able to kindle you. Send our insights to their goal. The gods eat the oblation poured in you. Convey the Ādityas here, for we are eager for them. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm.


1. For Jātavedas we will press soma. He will burn down the property of the hostile. He will carry us across all difficult passages, across difficult transits, as if with a boat across a river—Agni.


śrád-dhā “trust” in


mythic hero Āyu is the son of the Apsaras Urvaśī and the mortal king Purūravas, but his lot was cast with mortals when his mother abandoned him (see X.95), and in this sense his true origins have been, at the least, muddied. But there is a more positive aspect to this phrase; since he and the other Ārya continue to move forward into ever new territory, where they came from recedes into the background: their future is forward.


Have the poet’s fears been calmed after all? Has he really regained his faith in the efficacy of his own poetry and of the sacrifice they serve? Or will the wolf prey upon him again? The hymn leaves these questions open and in this way subtly and uninsistently undermines the reassuring structure of the poem and destabilizes its architecture. It is a masterful stroke.


1. Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, the Maruts’ troop, and Aditi do we call upon for help. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 2. O Ādityas, come here for our wholeness; o gods, become luck itself in the overcoming of obstacles. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 3. Let the Fathers help us, those good to proclaim, and the two goddesses [=Heaven and Earth], whose sons are the gods, strong through truth. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 4. Inciting the prizewinner Narāśaṃsa here—with appeals for grace we beg Pūṣan, who rules over heroes. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 5. O Br̥haspati, make easy passage for us always. The luck and lifetime of yours that was set in place by Manu—that we beg for. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 6. Kutsa the seer, squeezed down into a pit, called on Indra, smasher of Vr̥tra, lord of power, for help. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us from all narrow straits. 7. Let goddess Aditi, with the gods, keep guard over us. Let the god Protector protect us, not keeping his distance. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


yád “when”


in the first two verses that he seeks a better state and must turn to Indra and Agni for help because his kin-group is unreliable. This is expressed in general terms in the first verse, but in bitter particulars in the second. Interestingly the deficient relatives in that verse are both connections through the female line: his daughter’s husband and his wife’s brother (the word syālá is specialized for this relationship). In a patrilocal system like that of ancient India, neither of them would have particularly close ties to him.

Notes: 1) i believe that he is saying in terms of pleasure one gets if his daughter is happy with her husband or the brother in law gives a lot of gifts or do not interefer in his life.it is more of mental peace and indra etc caan always offer better peace then them. 


Every day has a dawn and every day’s dawn is, in some sense, the same, while being quite distinct. Today’s dawn has been preceded by countless many and will be followed by countless many; she is both last and first. But she is also the capitalized and personified single Dawn.


1. These poetic thoughts do we proffer to Rudra, the powerful one with braided hair who rules over heroes, so that he will be luck for our two-footed and four-footed, so that everything in this settlement will be flourishing, free of affliction. 2. Be merciful to us, Rudra, and create joy for us. To you who rule over heroes we would do honor with reverence. Whatever luck and lifetime Father Manu won through sacrifice, that may we attain under your guidance, Rudra. 3. May we attain your benevolence though sacrifice to the gods, the benevolence of you who rule over heroes, o reward-granting Rudra. Bestowing only favor, come roaming toward our clans: possessing heroes who cannot be harmed, we will pour you an oblation. 266 I.115 4. We call down turbulent Rudra for help, the wandering poet who brings the sacrifice to success. In the distance from us let him shoot his divine anger. It is just his benevolence we choose. 5. We call down with reverence the boar of heaven, flame-red, with braided hair, turbulent in form. Bearing in his hand desirable healing remedies, he will extend shelter, covering, and protection to us. 6. This speech here is spoken to the father of the Maruts—speech sweeter than sweet, strengthening to Rudra. Both grant us, immortal one, what nourishes mortals, and be merciful to our selves, to our progeny and posterity. 7. Not the great one among us nor the wee little one, not the growing one among us nor the grown— don’t smite our father nor our mother. Don’t harm our own dear bodies, Rudra. 8. Don’t do harm to our progeny and posterity nor to our (own) lifespan, not to our cows nor to our horses. Don’t smite our heroes, Rudra, when enraged. We, with our oblations, will always invoke you. 9. Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you. Grant your favor to us, father of the Maruts, for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful. It is just your aid that we choose. 10. In the distance be your cow-smiting and men-smiting (anger). You who rule over heroes, let your favor be on us. Both be merciful to us and speak on our behalf, o god, and then extend double-lofty shelter to us. 11. We have spoken reverence to him, seeking his aid. Let Rudra, accompanied by the Maruts, hear our call. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


1. The brilliant face of the gods has arisen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni; he has filled heaven, earth, and the space between: the Sun is the life-breath of both the moving and the still.


6. Today, o gods, at the rising of the Sun, deliver us from distress and from disgrace. – This let Mitra and Varuıa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.


“having twisted” ( právr̥kta)


1. What oblation to you will bring success, Aśvins? Who will be to the liking of you both? How will he make offering?—he, an inattentive man! 2. He should ask just the two [=the Aśvins] who know about the doors—he, the man who does not know properly, who later (would be) without insight. Never are the two inactive around the mortal. 280 I.121 3. We call upon you two knowing ones. Knowing, you should speak to us a (poetic) thought today. Distributing portions, the one seeking you chants forth. 4. In my naïvete﻿́ I ask (you), not (other) gods, about the unerring (soma), created with the vaṣaṭ-call, o wondrous ones. Protect us from the more powerful and the more violent one! 5. (The Speech that says,) “I who cry forth as if at the Bhr̥gavāna (fire), who am beautiful, I the Speech by which Pajriya [=Kakṣīvant] sacrifices to you”— seeking refreshment, (I do) not (cry) forth (such Speech) as one who knows. 6. Hear the song of Takavāna, even though I have rasped it out to you, Aśvins. (Set) your eyes here, lords of beauty, upon our home. 7. Because you two were in great joy surely (then) when you had jerked it away— o good ones, you should be fine herdsmen for us!—protect us from the ill-wishing wolf. 8. Do not betray us to a nobody (who is) our enemy. Do not let our cows go from our house to a nowhere place, giving sustenance from their udders, though without young. 9. She should give milk in order to establish an alliance with you two. Measure us for wealth accompanied by prizes of victory, and measure us for nourishment accompanied by cattle. 10. I have won the horseless chariot of the Aśvins with their prizewinning mares. By it I enjoy abundant delight. 11. In every way this easy-moving chariot will carry me again and again among the peoples, o body (of mine), to the soma-drinking. 12. So then, I take no account of a dream nor of a rich man who gives no sustenance. Both these vanish in the morning.


3. Let the earth-circling one [=Wind], rising at early morning, invigorate us. Let the Wind, (child?) of the waters, accompanied by bulls, invigorate us. Sharpen us, o Indra and “Mountain” [=Indra’s mace]. Let all the gods then create wide space for us.


I.123 Dawn Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa 13 verses: triṣṭubh One of the loveliest of the R̥gvedic Dawn hymns.


8. (Let) Indra (be) more and more preeminent among us with his self-glorious help in the shunning of bad thoughts—in the shattering of bad thoughts. She herself [=Bad Thought] is to be harmed who has sought us out with her devourers. She will be smashed, she will not wax strong—like a firebrand flung aside she will not wax strong.


1. Both world-halves I purify with truth; the deceits—great, but lacking Indra—I burn up entirely, where the enemies, having attacked, lay slain, crushed all around the Place of Hostility.


Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the I.139 311 shining forth”),


Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the I.139 311 shining forth”), who in later Vedic and even in late R̥gveda (Vālakh., VIII.52.1) is considered the father of Manu and who is often associated, as a proto-priest, with the pressing of soma. (His Avestan correspondent Vīvaŋuuaṇt is the first man who pressed haoma [Y 9.4].)


3. His are the dazzling, his the unaging radiant beams—he possessing a lovely appearance, a lovely face, a lovely flash. 320 I.144 The (beams) of Agni, with the energy of their radiance, are churning like rivers of the night, across (the nights), unsleeping, unaging.


8. Staying close, o Agni, protect us with your kindly, able protectors that stay close. With your undeceivable, undistracted, unwinking (protectors), o object of our quest, protect our kindred all around.


1. Ask him: he has come; he knows. As the one who perceives, he is implored; he is now implored here. In him are our commands, in him our wishes [/offerings]. He is the lord of the victory prize and of unbridled power. 2. Just him do they ask, but he himself does not ask in turn, since, like a clever man, with his own mind he has grasped it. He does not forget the first nor the later word. Undistracted, he is accompanied by his resolve. 3. Just to him go the offering ladles; to him the mares [=streams of ghee?]. He alone will hear all my words. Enjoining many ritual commands, triumphant, bringing the sacrifice to success, offering uninterrupted help, (though) a child, he has taken on his ferocity entirely. 4. He proceeds in a reverential approach (to them) when they [=flames?] have raised themselves up together. Just born, he has crept together with the conjoined ones. He touches the swelling one for joy and delight, when the willing females [=streams of ghee?] go to him standing right there. 5. This wild beast of the waters that roams in the woods has been installed upon the uppermost skin. He has declared the (ritual) patterns to mortals—the knowing Agni. For he is the perceiver of truth who is really present (here).

Notes: 1) the uppermost skin can be our uppermost layer our exposure to the outside world.the fire of greed etc starts from there.agni has toldusso anditsuptous to be. 


4. O Agni, the ungenerous one wishing us ill and full of hostility who harms us by his duplicity, let this heavy spell be back at him: he should bring harm upon his own body by his evil words. 5. Or, o strong one, the mortal who with premeditation harms a mortal by his duplicity, from him protect your praiser, o you who are praised. Agni, no one should give us over to distress.


One of the only hymns dedicated entirely to Viṣṇu,


Likewise, the description of the Aśvins’ sending fire and water into the trees (vs. 6) refers to the water, which not only allows the trees to grow but also carries fire that emerges when wood is kindled.


1. Agni has awakened; the Sun rises from the earth; great, glowing Dawn has dawned widely with her ray of light. The Aśvins have harnessed their chariot to make their journey. The god Savitar has spurred the living world in all directions.


4. Carry nourishment to us, Aśvins, and mix us with your honeyed whip. Extend our lifetime, wipe away our diseases, repel hatred, and be companions to us.


12. When, having shut your eyes, you crept around the living worlds, where were your loving parents? I.162 343 You cursed him who took your arm. Who made a declaration (to you), to him you also made a declaration. 13. After you slept, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Who awakened us here, o Agohya?” The billy-goat [=the Sun?] said the dog [=the Moon?] was the awakener. Here today, after a year, you opened your eyes. 14. The Maruts travel through heaven, Agni along the earth; the Wind here travels through the midspace; Varuṇa travels through the waters and seas—seeking you, o sons of strength. The


ritual (adhiyajñam) and to the world (adhidevatam),


human body or the human being (adhyātmam).


1. This treasured one, the gray Hotar—his middle brother is the ravenous one; his third brother is the one with ghee-smeared back. In him I saw the clanlord with his seven sons. 2. The seven harness the chariot with a single wheel [=the Sun]. A single horse with seven names draws it. Triple-naved [=with three seasons?] is the unaging, unassailable wheel, on which all these living beings rest. 3. As its seven horses, the seven [=the priests] who stand upon this chariot [=the sacrifice] draw the seven-wheeled (chariot). Seven sisters [=voices of the priests] together cry out (the words) in which the seven names of the cows [=poetic speech] are imprinted. 4. Who has seen the first one [=the Sun/Agni] as he is being born, when his boneless (mother) [=the Waters?] carries the one having bones [=the one who is a living being]? Where is the life, blood, and breath of the earth? Who will approach the knowing one to ask this? I.164 355 5. Naïve, not understanding, in my mind I ask about these imprinted tracks of the gods. Upon the full-grown calf [=the fire] the poets have stretched the seven warp-threads (of the sacrifice) in order to weave. 6. Unperceptive, I ask also the perceptive poets about this in order to know, since I am unknowing: What also is the One in the form of the Unborn [=the Sun] that has propped apart these six realms (of heaven and earth)? 7. Let him speak here, who knows the imprinted track of this treasured bird [=the Sun]. The cows [=rain clouds] yield milk [=rain] from his head [=the Sun]. Clothing themselves in a cloak, they have drunk water with the foot [=the Sun’s rays]. 8. The mother [=Dawn] gave her father [=the Sun/Heaven] a share in the truth, for in the beginning, through her insight, she united (with him) by her mind. Recoiling, she whose essence was her child [=Agni/the Sun] was pierced (by her father). Just those offering their reverence went to the (morning) invocation. 9. The mother was harnessed to the yoke-pole of the sacrificial reward; her child stood up amid the penned cows. The calf [=Agni] bellowed and looked toward the cow of every color [=Dawn], three wagon-treks (in the distance). 10. Carrying three mothers [=earths] and three fathers [=heavens] alone, he [=the Sun] stands upright: they do not cause him to weary. On the back of yonder heaven they [=the gods] recite the speech that knows everything but does not inspire everyone. 11. Twelve-spoked, the wheel of truth [=the Sun] ever rolls around heaven—yet not to old age. Upon it, o Agni, stand seven hundred twenty sons in pairs [=the nights and days of the year]. 12. They speak of the father [=the Moon] with five feet [=the seasons] and twelve forms [=the months], the overflowing one in the upper half of heaven. But these others speak of the far-gazing one [=the Sun] in the nearer (half) fixed on (the chariot) with seven wheels [=the Sun, Moon, and visible planets] and six spokes [=the seasons, in a different reckoning]. 13. In the five-spoked wheel [=the year] that rolls round—on that do all living beings take their stand. Its axle does not become hot, though its load is heavy. From of old it, along with its nave, does not break apart. 356 I.164 14. Along with its felly, the unaging wheel [=the night Sun] has turned away. Harnessed to the outstretched (yoke-pole) [=the airy realm?], ten (horses) draw it. Covered over, the eye of the Sun moves through the airy realm. All living beings are fixed upon it. 15. They speak of the seventh of those who are born at the same time as the one born alone, saying, “the twins, the Seers born of the gods, are only six.” What (places) are desired by these [=the Seven Seers] are distributed according to their spheres. While (the one) [=the pole star] stands still, the ones varied in appearance [=the stars of the Seven Seers] quiver. 16. Though they [=the Kr̥ttikās, the Pleiades] are women, yet they speak of them as men to me. He who has eyes sees; the blind man does not differentiate. One who is a poet, a (poet’s) son, perceives them. One who recognizes these (women), he will be the father of his father. 17. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here [=at the horizon], the cow [=Dawn] carrying her calf [=the Sun] has stood up by her foot. In which direction is she? Toward which side did she go away? Where does she give birth, for it is not within the fold? 18. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here is he [=the Sun] who knows his father. Showing himself to be a poet, who will proclaim this here: from whence has divine thought been born? 19. What (chariots [=sacrifices?] come) this way—they say that those (will go) away; what (chariots go) away—they say that those (will come) this way. O Soma and Indra, (the deeds) that you two have done, these draw (those chariots) like (horses) harnessed to the yoke-pole of the airy realm. 20. Two well-feathered (birds), yokemates and companions, embrace the same tree. Of those two the one eats the sweet fig; the other, not eating, keeps watch. 21. Where the well-feathered (birds), never blinking, cry out for a share of immortality and for the ritual distributions, here the forceful herdsman of the whole living world, the insightful one, has entered me, the naïve one. 22. Just that tree on which all the honey-eating, well-feathered ones settle and give birth, they say, has the sweet fig at its top. He who does not know the father will not reach up to that. I.164 357 23. How the gāyatrī (track) [=gāyatrī line] is based upon a gāyatrī (hymn) or how a triṣṭubh (track) [=triṣṭubh line] was fashioned out of a triṣṭubh (hymn), or how the jagat track [=jagatī line] is based on the jagat [=jagatī] (hymn)—only those who know this have reached immortality. 24. By the gāyatrī (track) [=line] one measures the chant; by the chant the melody; by the triṣṭubh (track) [=line] (one measures) the recitation; by the two-footed and the four-footed recitation the (full) recitation. By the syllable the seven voices assume their measure. 25. By the jagat [=jagatī] (stanza) he buttressed the river in heaven; in the rathantara (chant), he watched over the Sun. They say that there are three kindling sticks [=three lines in a gāyatrī stanza] belonging to the gāyatrī (stanza). By its greatness it [=the gāyatrī stanza] has passed beyond those in greatness. 26. I summon this milk-cow giving good milk, and the deft-handed milker will milk her. Savitar will impel the most excellent impetus in us. The gharma pot has been heated: this shall I proclaim. 27. Making the sound hiṅ, the goods-mistress of goods, seeking her calf, has come near through (my) thinking. Let this inviolable cow give milk to the Aśvins. Let her increase for our great good fortune. 28. The cow bellowed after her blinking calf. She made the sound hiṅ against his head (for him) to bellow. Lowing toward his hot jaw, she bellows her bellow and swells her swell of milk. 29. This hums—that by which the cow is enclosed. She bellows her bellow, resting upon the smoky (fire). Because she has put down (what is) mortal with the sound “chit-chit,” becoming lightning, she pushed away her covering. 30. Breathing, life rests (though remaining) on its headlong course, stirring (though) steadfast in the midst of the dwelling places. The living one keeps moving by the will of the dead one; the immortal one shares the same womb with the mortal one. 31. I saw the herdsman who never settles down, roaming here and afar along his paths. Clothing himself in those that converge and diverge, he moves back and forth among living beings. 32. He who created him does not know him. He is far away from him who has seen him. He is surrounded within the womb of his mother. Having many offspring, he has entered into destruction. 358 I.164 33. [The Sun:] “My father, my progenitor, is Heaven; here is my navel. My mother, this great Earth, is my relation. My womb is within the two open cups [=Heaven and Earth]. Here my father placed the child [=the Sun] of his daughter [=Dawn].” 34. I ask you about the farthest end of the earth. I ask where is the navel of the living world. I ask you about the seed of the bull(-like) horse. I ask about the highest heaven of speech. 35. This altar here is the farthest end of the earth. This sacrifice here is the navel of the living world. This soma here is the seed of the bull(-like) horse. This formulator here is the highest heaven of speech. 36. The seven children of the (two world-)halves [=the Seven Seers], the seed of the living world, take their place by the direction of Viṣṇu in the spreading expanse. By their insights and their thought these encompassing perceivers of inspired words encompass (everything) everywhere. 37. I do not understand what sort of thing I am here: though bound, I roam about in secret by my thinking. When the first-born of truth [=Agni] has come to me, only then do I attain a share of this speech here. 38. He goes inward and outward, controlled by his own will—he, the immortal one of the same womb as the mortal one. Those two are ever going apart in different directions. They observe the one; they do not observe the other. 39. The syllable of the verse, upon which all the gods have settled, is in the highest heaven— he who does not know that (syllable), what will he accomplish by his verse? Only those who know it sit together here. 40. Because you would become blessed, feeding upon good pasturage, so then we would also be blessed. Feed on grass always, o inviolable cow [=Speech]! Coming here, drink pure water! 41. The buffalo-cow [=Speech] has bellowed, fashioning oceans. One-footed and two-footed, she is four-footed, having become eight-footed and nine-footed: she has a thousand syllables in the highest heaven. 42. Seas flow everywhere from her: by that the four directions live, from that the syllable flows, upon that does everything live. 43. At the midpoint, beyond this nearer (fire), I saw dung-smoke from afar. Heroes cooked the dappled bullock. These were the first foundations (of the rite). I.164 359 44. Three long-haired ones gaze out in succession: in a year one [=Agni] of them shears away (the land) for himself; another [=the Sun] gazes upon everything with his powers; the rush of another [=Wind] is visible, but not his form. 45. Speech is measured in four feet [/quarters]. Brahmins of inspired thinking know these. They do not set in motion the three that are imprinted in secret; the sons of Manu speak the fourth (foot/quarter) of speech. 46. They say it is Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni, and also it is the winged, well-feathered (bird) of heaven [=the Sun]. Though it is One, inspired poets speak of it in many ways. They say it is Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan. 47. Along the dark course, tawny well-feathered (birds) [=flames], clothing themselves in the waters, fly up toward heaven. These have returned here (as rain) from the seat of truth [=heaven]. Only then is the earth moistened with ghee. 48. The chariot-wheel (of the Sun) is one, its wheel-segments are twelve, its wheel-naves are three: who understands this? They [=the days] that wander on and on are fitted together on that, like three hundred pegs, like sixty (more). 49. Your breast, which is ever full, which is joy itself, by which you make all desirable things prosper, which confers treasure and finds wealth, which brings good gifts—o Sarasvatī, you prepare that to suckle us here. 50. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice: these were the first foundations. These, its greatnesses, followed to heaven’s vault, where the ancient Sādhyas and the gods are. 51. This water remains the same: it goes up and down throughout the days. Thunderstorms vivify the earth, and fires vivify heaven. 52. The heavenly well-feathered, lofty bird, child of the waters, and beautiful (child) of the plants, the one bringing satisfaction by the rains from what is bounded by waters: Sarasvant!—him do I call upon again and again for help.


Kutsa, the horses of the Wind,

Notes: 1)  man is swifter than mind.it travels in three directions....past.present.future.it takes us to dwelling of gods. 


1. Harness that which is swifter than mind, which has a triple chariot-box and three wheels, o bulls, with which you drive right up to the dwelling of the good performer (of rituals). You fly with the tripartite (chariot) like a bird with its feathers. 2. The smooth-rolling chariot rolls on as it goes toward earth, when you stand on it, resolved to fortify (us). Let this hymn here accompany the wonder with wonderment; you keep company with Dawn, the Daughter of Heaven. 3. Mount your smooth-rolling chariot, the one providing the oblations that rolls on according to your commandments, by which you two, o Nāsatyas, superior men, drive your circuit for our descendants and ourselves to prosper. 4. Let neither the wolf nor the she-wolf venture against you. Do not avoid (us) nor pass (us) by. Here is the portion deposited for you, here the hymn, o wondrous ones, and here the deposits of honey for you. 5. Gotama, Purumīḍha, Atri—(each one), providing the oblations, summons you two for help, o wondrous ones. Like those going in a straight line to the directed direction, drive here to my summons, o Nāsatyas. 6. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness. A praise hymn has been set out in response to you, o Aśvins. Drive just here along the paths leading to the gods. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. Which of these two is the earlier, and which the later? How were they born, o poets? Who fully understands? By themselves the two carry everything that is a name. Day and Night roll through (them) like two wheels. 2. The two, unmoving and footless, conceive an ample embryo, moving and footed, like a natural son in the lap of his parents. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 3. I invoke the gift of Aditi, which is without fault, without aggression, without weapon, and provided with sunlight and reverence. O you two world-halves, beget it for the singer. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 4. We should be devoted to the two who are never scorched, (always) giving help with their help, to the two world-halves whose children are the gods, to the pair among the gods, along with the pairs among the days. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 5. The two young women, sisters, siblings [=Night and Dawn?], contiguous and uniting with each other in the lap of their parents, sniff-kissing the navel of the world. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 6. The two broad and lofty seats do I invoke with truth, the begetters of the gods with their help, they of lovely countenance who conceive the immortal one. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 7. The two, broad and wide, voluminous and of distant boundary, do I address with homage in this sacrifice, who, bringing good fortune and advancing well, conceive (the embryo). – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 8. If we have ever committed any offence at all against the gods or against a comrade or against the lord of the family, this hymnic vision should be propitiation to them. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void. 9. Let both lauds belonging to men help me; let both (Heaven and Earth) accompany me with aid, with help. There is much for him who gives even more than the stranger. Becoming exhilarated by the refreshment, might we be refreshed, o gods. 10. I of good wisdom have spoken this truth to Heaven and to Earth to hear first. Let the two of them protect from disgrace and difficulty in close quarters. Let the mother and father guard (us) with their help. 390 I.186 11. Let this come true, Heaven and Earth, which I address to you two, o Father and Mother. Become the nearest of the gods with your help. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. Now I shall praise food, the support and power of the great, by whose might Trita shook Vr̥tra apart till his joints were parted. 2. O sweet food, honeyed food, we have chosen you: for us be a helper. 3. Draw near to us, food—kindly with your kindly help, joy itself, not to be despised, a very kind companion without duplicity. 4. These juices of yours, food, are dispersed throughout the realms, adjoined to heaven like the winds. 5. These (juices) are those that yield you, o food, and they also are part of you, sweetest food. Those who receive the sweetness of your juices press forward like strong-necked (bulls). 6. On you, food, is the mind of the great gods set. A dear (deed) was done at your signal: he smashed the serpent with your help. 7. When yonder dawning light of the mountains has come, o food, then you should also come here to us, honeyed food, fit for our portion. 8. When we bite off a full share of the waters and plants, o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 9. When we take a share of you when mixed with milk or mixed with grain, o Soma, o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 10. Become the gruel, o plant, the fat, the steaming [?] suet [?], o you friend of the winds—become just the fat. 11. We have sweetened you with words, o food, as cows [=milk] (do) the oblations— you as feasting companion for the gods, you as feasting companion for us.


1. O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path, since you know all the (ritual) patterns, o god. Keep from us transgression, going its crooked way. Might we offer you the greatest expression of reverence. 2. O Agni, deliver us anew to the far shore, beyond all hardships, with your blessings. And become a wide fortress, thick and broad, for us, and luck and lifetime for our progeny and posterity. 3. O Agni, keep from us afflictions, (so) they will afflict peoples without Agni’s protection. Renew the earth for us to go easily upon it, o god worthy of the sacrifice, along with all the immortals. 4. Protect us, Agni, with your unwearying protectors, and when you blaze here in your own dear seat. Let not fear find your singer, neither now nor later, o youngest mighty one. 5. Do not release us, Agni, to the evil man, nor to the greedy one, the cheat, nor to misfortune. Do not hand us over to the toothed one who bites nor to the toothless, nor to one who does harm, o strong one. 6. One like you, o Agni born of truth, when hymned, will stretch wide a shield for our body I.190 395 from everyone who seeks to harm or to revile—for you watch widely over crooked ways, o god. 7. Distinguishing between the two [=sacrificers and non-sacrificers?], you pursue the sons of Manu at the early mealtime, o Agni worthy of the sacrifice. At the later mealtime you become tractable for Manu, to be groomed like a foal [?] by the fire-priests. 8. We have spoke enigmas in his presence—I, the son of Māna, (have spoken them) in the presence of mighty Agni. May we win a thousand together with the seers. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.


1. With chants I will strengthen anew the unassailable bull of gladdening tongue, Br̥haspati, the brightly shining leader of song to whom the gods and the mortals harken as he bellows.


I.191 Against Poisonous Animals Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi


Brahmaṇaspati or Br̥haspati, the “lord of the sacred formulation”


Noteworthy among them are II.33, one of only three hymns in the R̥gveda to Rudra, II.35, the only hymn in the R̥gveda dedicated to Apām Napāt, the “Child of the Waters,” and II.38, a hymn to Savitar that shows his role as the god of the evening who brings the world to rest.


The effect of this incantatory repetition of “you, Agni,” taking place in front of the sacrificial fire on the ritual ground, combined with the sweep of equations identifying Agni with what comes to seem like everything on earth and in heaven, is to concentrate all of the cosmos into this small space, the sacrifical ground, and this single entity, the sacrificial fire—indeed making the sacrificial microcosm the equivalent of the macrocosm. The ordering of the identifications—starting and ending at the sacrifice, but in between ranging through both the divine and human realms—models the centrality of the sacrifice and of its focus, the sacred fire. It is a powerful beginning to the maṇḍala and to the Family Books in general.


1. You, Agni, (are born) throughout the days, you who are eager to blaze here; you (are born) from the waters, you from the stone, you from the trees, you from the plants, you, men-lord of men, are born blazing. 2. Yours, Agni, is the office of Hotar; yours that of Potar in its turn; yours that of Neṣṭar; you are the Agnidh [=Fire-Kindler] of the one who follows truth. Yours is the office of Praśāstar; you act as Adhvaryu; you are both the Brahman-priest and the houselord in our home. 3. You, Agni, as bull of beings, are Indra; you, wide-going, worthy of homage, are Viṣṇu. You, o lord of the sacred formulation, finder of wealth, are the Brahman [=Formulator]; you, o Apportioner, are accompanied by Plenitude. 4. You, Agni, whose commandments are steadfast, are King Varuṇa; you, wondrous to be invoked, become Mitra. You, as the lord of settlements who (offers) a common meal, are Aryaman; you, apportioning at the ritual distribution, o god, are Aṃśa [/Share]. 5. You, Agni, (giving wealth) rich in heroes to the one who does honor, are Tvaṣṭar—yours is kinship, o you accompanied by the Wives (of the Gods) and possessing Mitra’s might— You have given (wealth) rich in horses as the impeller of swift (horses) [=Child of the Waters]. You of many goods are the troop of men [=Maruts]. 6. You, Agni, as lord of great heaven, are Rudra; you, as the troop of Maruts, are master of strengthening nourishment [=rain]. You, as luck for livestock, drive with the ruddy winds (as horses); you, as Pūṣan, protect the ones doing honor, in your own person. 402 II.1 7. You, Agni, are Wealth-Giver to the preparer (of the offering); you, as the conferrer of treasure, are god Savitar. You, lord of men, as Bhaga [/Fortune] are master of goods; you are a protector in the house of him who has done you honor. 8. Toward you, Agni, as clanlord in the house do the clans stretch out straight—toward you, the king, easy to find. You, lovely-faced one, are lord over all; you are the counter(part) to thousands, hundreds, tens. 9. To you, Agni, as father, (do) men (approach) with their desires—to you, for brotherhood, (do they approach) with their (ritual) labor, you who are bright in body. You become the son of him who has done you honor; you as affectionate comrade—protect (him) from assault. 10. You, Agni, as [R̥bhu/] the craftsman at hand, are to be rendered homage; you are master of the cattle-rich prize [/Vāja], of wealth. You radiate widely [/(are) Vibhvan]: burn through to giving! You seek to carve up and to stretch out the sacrifice. 11. You, god Agni, are Aditi for the pious; you, as Hotrā Bhāratī, are strengthened by song. You are Iḍā, bestowing a hundred winters in return for skill; you, o lord of goods, as obstacle-smasher, are Sarasvatī. 12. You, Agni, when well kept, are highest vigor. In your coveted color there are beauties in sight. You are the prize, furthering and lofty; you are wealth, ample, broad on all sides. 13. You, Agni, did the Ādityas make their mouth; you did the pure ones make their tongue, o poet. You do the Gift-Escorts escort in the ceremonies; in you do the gods eat the poured oblation. 14. O Agni, through your mouth do all the undeceptive immortals, the gods, eat the oblation poured into you. With you the mortals sweeten their pressed drink. You, as embryo of the plants, were born blazing. 15. You are both equal and a counter(part) to these by your might, and, o Agni, well-born god, you surpass them, since your strengthening nourishment here extends in its greatness through heaven and earth, through both world-halves. 16. The patrons—those who dispatch to the praisers a gift tipped with cows and ornamented with horses, o Agni— lead both us and them forth to a better state. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.


4. Become our bounteous patron, o lord of goods who gives goods. Keep hatreds away from us.


6. May we be accompanied by the help of Agni, of Indra, of Soma, of (all) the gods— not suffering harm. May we surmount those who do battle.


2. You are the messenger, and you are our protector afar; you, bull, are our leader to a better (state). O Agni, for the prolonging of our progeny and of our own selves, become, as you shine, a herdsman who does not stay away.


ūrvá, the “containers,”


Note that śate﻿́na “with a hundred” is the hundredth word of the hymn.


But it is reflected also in mortals’ efforts: men contend to win the sun (vs. 4d), and the sacrificers strive to win as if in a race (vs. 7).


1. We call upon you, the troop-lord of troops, the most famous poet of poets, the preeminent king of sacred formulations, o lord of the sacred formulation. Hearing us, sit down upon your seat together with your help.


“he will win against those who seek to win” ( vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ)


11. I see far neither to the right nor to the left, neither forward nor behind, Ādityas. Be it in naïveté or in wisdom, you good ones, led by you, might I attain the light free from fear.


14. O Aditi, Mitra, and Varuṇa, have mercy if we have committed any offense against you. Might I reach the broad light that is free of fear, Indra. Let the long darkness (of death) not reach us.


This is the only hymn to Varuṇa alone in Maṇḍala II,


5. Loosen my offense from me like a halter. We would succeed in reaching the wellspring of your truth, Varuṇa. Let my thread not be cut as I weave my insight. Let not the full measure of my work be broken before its season.


6. Unfasten fear from me, o Varuṇa! Hold me close, o truth-possessing, universal king! Like a rope from a calf, untie confining straits (from me), for I cannot be away from you even for the blink of an eye.


6. Unfasten fear from me, o Varuṇa! Hold me close, o truth-possessing, universal king! Like a rope from a calf, untie confining straits (from me), for I cannot be away from you even for the blink of an eye. 7. (Strike) us not with your deadly weapons, o Varuṇa, which, in your hunt (for him), injure the one who commits an offense, o lord! Let us not go from light into foreign lands! Loosen our lapses for us to live!


of an eye.


11. Let me not find the lack of a dear benefactor, of a friend with many gifts, o Varuṇa. Let me not descend from wealth easy to control, o king. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.


2. You, gods, are solicitude; you are strength; you—keep hatreds far away. As apportioners, be indulgent and be merciful to us, both today and for the future. 3. What shall we do now with your future (friendship), what, good ones, with your old friendship? You—Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aditi, Indra and the Maruts—establish well-being for us. 4. Hail, gods: only you are our friends. Be merciful to me who am in need. Let our chariot not come to be without you when it is travelling in the middle (of battle/a journey?); let us not become weary while we have friends like you. 5. I alone have perpetrated a great offense against you, for which you have chastised me, like a father (his son, who is) a gambler. In the distance (be) your fetters, in the distance evils, o gods; do not seize


me in my son, like a bird.


“those seeking fame” ( śravasyávaḥ)


II.33 (224) Rudra Gr̥tsamada 15 verses: triṣṭubh Although under his transferred epithet Śiva (“kindly one”), Rudra has a grand career ahead of him in post-Vedic Hinduism, his role in Vedic, especially early Vedic, is relatively restrained. Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi- cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe- cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand, he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows, at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and of good luck.


Śiva (“kindly one”),


Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi- cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe- cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand, he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows, at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and of good luck.


This is the only R̥gvedic hymn devoted to the divinity Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters,” though he is mentioned on a number of occasions elsewhere in the text. This divine name is also found identically in Avestan, but in the R̥gveda it is in the course of becoming an epithet of Agni.


the rule of maṇḍala organization, whereby hymns within a single group contain descending number of verses.


According to Falk, in the second millennium BCE on this night the Milky Way rose from the horizon at dusk. The arc of the Milky Way, he says, was pictured as the outstretched arms of Savitar. Be that as it may, most of the images in the hymn are applicable to evening in general.


1. God Savitar has stood up to impel again as always—the draft-horse whose work this is— II.38 457 for now he distributes treasure to the gods, and he has also given a share in well-being to him whose oblations are worth pursuing. 2. Because the god, erect and with broad hands, extends his arms for all to obey, even the waters are submissive to his commandment and even this wind here rests in its circling. 3. Even the one who drives with swift (horses) will now unhitch. He has brought to rest even the wanderer from his travelling. He has held in check the greed even of the snake-stickers [?] . Following the commandment of Savitar, “Release” [=Evening] has come. 4. Once again the weaver has wrapped up what was stretched out; in the middle of his work the mindful (worker) has set down his craft. Having pulled himself together, he [=Savitar] has stood up. He has always kept the seasons separate. As Proper Thinking, god Savitar has come. 5. The domestic blaze of fire is dispersed prominently throughout the houses, one for each, for (each one’s) whole lifetime. The mother has set out the best portion for her son, according to his intention, which has been aroused by Savitar. 6. (Whatever) was dispersed seeking gain has been gathered together. Desire for home has arisen in all who roam. Each and every one has come, abandoning unfinished work, following the commandment of the divine Savitar. 7. The watery (race) has been placed by you among the waters; the wild beasts have been dispersed throughout the wastelands, as their share; the forests are for birds. No one violates these commandments of god Savitar. 8. As far as (Savitar’s) benefit extends, Varuṇa (has come) to his watery womb, restlessly darting about at (every) blink (of the eye). Every mortal creature, (every) domestic beast has come to its pen. Savitar has distributed the races according to their stations. 9. Whose commandment neither Indra nor Varuṇa, neither Mitra nor Aryaman, nor Rudra violates, nor do hostile powers—for well-being I call him here with homage: god Savitar. 10. As (we) arouse Fortune, Insight, and Plenitude—Praise of Men, the husband of the Wives, should help us— might we be dear to god Savitar at the approach of a desirable thing and at the gathering of riches. 11. That desirable benefit given by you has come to us from heaven, from the waters, from earth, (a benefit) that will become weal for your praisers and your friend, the singer whose recitations extend widely, o Savitar.

The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi- bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son of Kata Vaiśvāmitra.


The hymn to Mitra is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra.


The hymn to Mitra is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra. The last hymn (62) is a collection of tr̥cas to six different deities or pairs of deities, including some not otherwise represented in the maṇḍala. The hymn would not be especially noteworthy, except that verse 10, dedicated to Savitar, is the Gāyatrī mantra, the best-known verse in the R̥gveda.

Vipāś and Śutudrī Rivers. The poet approaches the Rivers and asks them to stop in order to allow the Bhāratas to cross. These two rivers are the modern Beas and Sutlej,


In verse 10 Agni gives rise to Agni, and therefore Agni is also his own father. But then who is the father in verse 9? Geldner and Renou think that his father there is Heaven, Heaven’s udder the raincloud, and therefore the fire here is lightning. More likely, however, the reference is to the ritual fire.


Vaiśvānara, the sun.


Agni’s semen ( rétas) that “flows on high.” First, rétas is both present in pāda d and suggested by √ rī “ flow” in pāda b. Second, that which is “flowing on high” in pādas ab results in Agni’s birth in cd. Finally, the ellipsis of the object, which occurs between br̥hád / áriṇād, is solved in pāda d by bhū́ri-retasā “having abundant semen,” which echoes br̥hád / áriṇād phonologically and thereby suggests “semen” as the missing object. The mystery also brings back the theme of the Agni as sun and as sacrificial fire, since the fire who is single and who makes semen flow on high is likely the sun.

juhū́, the sacrificial ladle with which the butter offerings are poured in the fire. But she can also be the tongue of the poet—not so incidentally, another meaning of the word juhū́—or even the speech of the poets.


6. Since from you, son of strength, a god’s many forms of help go outward, and outward (also go) the prizes of victory, give us real wealth consisting of thousands through your undeceiving speech, Agni.

III.31 (265) Indra Kuśika Aiṣīrathi or Viśvāmitra Gāthina 22 verses: triṣṭubh This dense and often puzzling hymn has given rise to much discussion. The heart of the hymn (vss. 4–11 and passim throughout the rest of the hymn) provides one 508 III.31 of the fullest accounts in the R̥gveda of the Vala myth and especially of Indra and the Aṅgirases as they besiege the Vala cave and seek to free the cows within by means of song and ritual activity.


“win” (√ san)

It is an extraordinarily focused hymn, and its apparent simplicity may result not from artlessness, but from careful pruning.


1. For Vr̥tra-smashing capacity and for victory in battle— Indra—we turn you hither. 2. Let the cantors make your mind inclined our way— Indra of a hundred resolves—and your eye as well. 3. We implore your names with all our songs— Indra of a hundred resolves—in vanquishing hostility. 4. We magnify (him) through the hundred embodiments of the much-praised one, of Indra, the supporter of the settled domains. 5. Indra, much invoked, I call toward me to slay Vr̥tra, to win spoils in raids. 6. Be victorious when the prize (is set). We implore you, Indra of a hundred resolves, to slay Vr̥tra. 7. Amid brilliant outbursts on the battle-drive, amid claims to fame that bring success in battles, Indra, be victorious at the hostilities. 8. Drink the most unbridled, brilliant, wakeful soma— Indra of a hundred resolves—to aid us. 9. Your Indrian powers that are among the five peoples— Indra of a hundred resolves—those I want for myself. III.38 521 10. You have come, Indra, to lofty fame. Establish for yourself brilliance difficult to surpass. We exalt your unbridled power. 11. From nearby come here to us—also, able one, from afar. The broad space that is yours—Indra possessor of the stone—from that come here.

1. I will proclaim great Indra, toward whom all the soma-drinking communities have directed their desire, the very resolute one, fashioned for distinction, whom the two Holy Places [=Heaven and Earth] and the gods begot as the bane of obstacles. 2. The most manly sovereign king, mounted on fallow bays, whom now as before no one overcomes in battles, who along with his warriors is strongest through our fortifying (hymns). He in his broad expansion curtailed the lifetime of the Dasyu. 3. Victorious in battles like an overtaking steed, traversing the two world-halves, streaming abundance. Like Bhaga at the decisive moment, he is to be invoked with thoughts; like a father, he is dear, easy to invoke, conferring vigor. 4. As supporter of heaven, of the dusky realm, he is inquired after; erect like a chariot, he is (like) Vāyu teamed with goods. III.50 533 Illuminator of the nights, generator of the sun, he distributes the share, like the Holy Place [=ritual ground] the prize. 5. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory, the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

10. Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights.


11. Insight and lack of insight will the knowing one [=Agni] distinguish, like backs, straight and crooked, (like) mortals. And for the sake of wealth and good descendants for us, o god, both grant Diti [/Giving] and make wide space for Aditi [/Boundlessness].

Of truth the buttresses are firmly fixed; many are its gleaming marvels to be marveled at. By truth the nourishments urge themselves along the long way, and by truth the cows approached truth. 10. (Whoever) holds fast to truth, just he wins truth. The explosive force of truth hastens swiftly as it seeks cattle.

You have constantly conveyed the truth from of old. 7. You two great ones assure it success, as you further and fulfill the truth of Mitra. You have stationed yourself around the sacrifice. IV.57 (353) Agricultural Divinities Vāmadeva Gautama 8 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 6–7; triṣṭubh


The hymn is notable also for its address to the Furrow (vs. 6, see also 7), the first appearance of the feminine noun sī́tā, renowned in later Sanskrit of course as the name of Rāma’s noble wife in the Rāmāyaṇa.

In final verses poets occasionally refer to themselves and their people as “Atris” (22.4, 39.5, 40.9, 67.5)—a plural that only occurs in the Vth Maṇḍala.

A number of these feature riddles and verbal play, but none is as challenging as V.44, which Geldner called the most difficult hymn in the R̥gveda.

Svarbhānu, literally “he who possesses the radiance of the sun,” is actu- ally the Sun’s earthly counterpart, the god Agni. He punished the Sun for the lat- ter’s incestuous intercourse with his daughter (not mentioned in this hymn, but frequently found elsewhere), but because of the importance of sunlight for the maintenance of the world, the Sun had to be restored by the seer Atri (also the supposed poet of this hymn) through ritual means. The physical manifestations of the Sun’s punishment betray his attacker’s identity: “pierced with darkness” refers to sunspots, dark spots on the sun as if burnt by fire, and the enveloping darkness of smoke is depicted in verse 6.


The following series of hymns to the All Gods / All the Gods (V.41–51) contains some of the most complex and difficult poetry in the R̥gveda (along with some rest- fully more straightforward hymns), including the hymn that Geldner called “the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda” (“das schwierigste Lied des R̥V”), V.44. Although the placement of this series within the Saṃhitā was dictated by the strict and mechani- cal rules of numerical arrangement discussed before (see Intro. pp. 10–11), it is sometimes difficult for us not to view this set of hymns as a type of omphalos in the larger structure of the R̥gveda. They are found in more or less the middle of Maṇḍala V (which has 87 hymns), which is more or less the middle maṇḍala of the Family Books (II–VII—keeping in mind that, though V is preceded by three maṇḍalas and followed by two, the preceding maṇḍalas are shorter: II–IV contain 163 hymns, VI–VII 179, remarkably close to equivalence). Just as the omphalos verse in a hymn contains the enigma, the mysterious message of the hymn, so we could view these All God hymns as the mystical center of the older R̥gveda.


15. May this praise reach up to the Marutian troop, to the youthful sons of Rudra. Desire calls me to wealth with well-being. Praise the unruly ones with dappled horses. 16. May this praise reach to earth, to the midspace, to the trees, to the plants, for wealth. Let every god be easy for me to invoke. Let Mother Earth not set us in disfavor. 17. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods. 18. May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy itself and provides good guidance. Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here all that brings good fortune.


16. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods.

Notes: 1) for it will give us knowledge not only from our own past but also from those who took us from darkness to light; since time is space and space time.  


As noted above, Geldner considers this the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda


verse 1 represents an argument in favor of the new model of sacrifice including the Sacrificer’s Wife—then the lists of gods that follow might be a form of insurance.

Notes: 1) this is almost mid hyme of rigveda. 


1. Hitching up, she comes from heaven, she who is called the great mother of the Daughter (of Heaven [=Dawn]), waking (men), seeking to win, the youthful one, (coming) from the fathers, constantly calling in the seat (of the sacrifice)—(she is) Inspiration.


5. Here is the wonder, the enigma, people: that the rivers move, but the waters stay, that two, other than his mother, bear him—the two were born hither and yon but are twins, of the same lineage: (Sun and Agni).


1. I hasten toward god Savitar for you today, and toward Bhaga who apportions the treasure of Āyu. I would also turn hither you two superior men, who bring many enjoyments—seeking companionship with you, o Aśvins, day after day.


11. Well-being let the Aśvins, let Fortune mete out to us; well-being let the goddess Aditi, let the unassailable ones. Well-being let lord Pūṣan establish for us; well-being let Heaven and Earth, with kind attention. 12. For well-being we shall call upon Vāyu, on Soma; well-being (let him mete out) who is lord of creation. On Br̥haspati with his whole flock (we shall call) for well-being. For well-being let the Ādityas be there for us. 13. Let all the gods be there for us today, for well-being; let Vaiśvānara, Vasu, Agni (be there) for well-being. Let the gods, the R̥bhus give aid for (our) well-being. With well-being let Rudra protect us from constraint. 14. Well-being, o Mitra and Varuṇa, well-being, o rich Path. Well-being for us (let) Indra and Agni—well-being, o Aditi, make for us. 15. With well-being we would follow along our path, like the Sun and the Moon. May we meet up with one who gives in return, who does not smite, with one who knows.


14. May we cross over beyond scorners through your blessings, having left behind imperfection and hostilities. When it rains, the waters are luck and lifetime; at dawn they are medicine. May we be together with (them/you), o Maruts.

Also across 3ab samrā́jā ugrā́ vr̥ṣabhā́ divás pátī, pr̥thivyā́ mitrā́váruṇā vícarṣaṇī, the two lines have exactly the same metrical structure and repeated vowels in the same syllables. The hymn several times refers to the māyā́, the “cunning” of Mitra and Varuṇa (vss. 3, 4, 6, 7), which in its first and last attestations is described as the “cunning of a lord ( a﻿́sura)” (vss. 3, 7),


4. And you travel, Savitar, through the three luminous realms, and you are at home with the rays of the sun. And you encircle the night on both sides, and you become Mitra [/an ally], o god, through your supports.

12. O good one, manfully establish for us forever and for our progeny and posterity abundance of livestock. Let there be for us many lofty refreshments that keep evil at a distance and auspicious things bringing good fame. 13. Many goods many-fold in their goodness might I attain of you through seeking you, o King Agni. For many are the goods in you, o Agni of many favors, for the one who does (you) honor, since you are king.
