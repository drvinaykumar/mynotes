So it is one of our problems, whether we be educators or parents, to see that this inward excellence, innocence and vitality, which is destroyed through fear, through anxiety, greed and ambition, is never destroyed.


whether the other is sorry to leave or not has very little meaning, because it is your life, and you have to live it. It is you who have to face all the struggles, the miseries, and the joys. And to help you come out of it all, innocent, simple, and with a clear mind, is the function of education.


To navigate the vast, uncharted ocean of life demands an extraordinary capacity to meet its many hazards but, unfortunately, you are not educated for that; you are not told anything about it.


But when at last you meet the sea of life, the battle begins: there are fears, anxieties, despairs; there is deep questioning. Life becomes, for you, a terribly complex problem, a problem for which you want a very simple answer.


pursue some other philosophy or ideal in the hope of having a simple answer to everything. But there is no simple answer along any particular line.


Life is a most complex affair which most people do not understand and, being disturbed, they seek what they call God.


All that we know is what we have learnt from books. We merely repeat what we have read in the Gita, the Quran or the Bible and, thereby, think that we have solved our problems. We must be educated to go beyond the trained monkey, beyond the programmed machine, beyond the repetitive process which we call modern existence.


All that we know is what we have learnt from books. We merely repeat what we have read in the Gita, the Quran or the Bible and, thereby, think that we have solved our problems. We must be educated to go beyond the trained monkey, beyond the programmed machine, beyond the repetitive process which we call modern existence. To go beyond the repetitive process demands a brain that is extraordinarily alert, perceptive; and, surely, it is the function of education to bring about such a brain, rather than a brain which mechanically records and repeats what it has read in a book or heard the teacher say.


Everything around you is pouring its influence into you, and the first thing is to be aware of this, to become conscious of it, and not ask how one is to get rid of it.


Freedom from all influence is really the essence of an enlightened mind, because the enlightened mind is a light unto itself, and does not depend upon another.


How do you get the energy just to move from here to your room?—by eating, sleeping, being in good health, and also by having the desire to move from here to there. You also move when it is profitable to do so, or when there is fear, or when there is any other form of urgency.


How do you get the energy just to move from here to your room?—by eating, sleeping, being in good health, and also by having the desire to move from here to there. You also move when it is profitable to do so, or when there is fear, or when there is any other form of urgency. Similarly, when you really want to find out what is true, and you see the necessity of breaking through all influences, you will have the energy to do it. Energy comes with urgency. When the house is on fire, you have to do something about it at once, don’t you? It is no good picking up a book to see what it says about putting out a fire. The burning house demands that you act, and the very urgency of that demand gives you the energy to act. Similarly, when you realize the urgency of living without being influenced, and the urgency of doing something about the corruption and the rottenness that exist in this world, then you will have the energy to do it. Your life is a series of challenges which are constantly demanding immediate action and, when you face these challenges all the time, you will always have the required energy to meet them.  


But most of us have become dull. We have no real sense of urgency because we refuse to face the challenge of life. The challenge is there under our noses, it is not just for the few; any man can pick it up.


I don’t know if you have ever wondered why we imitate, copy, follow, obey, and fashion our thoughts after what somebody or the other has said. Life is extraordinarily swift and vital, but we reduce it to a few fixed patterns and live within those patterns.


The moment you accept authority, you are setting up a pattern, a framework within which your


Most people in the world—the old as well as the young—have this extraordinary sense of fear. There is the normal biological instinct to protect oneself, which makes one stay away from a venomous snake, and so on, but I am not talking about that. I am talking about the fears which are psychological, the fears which are under the skin.


A fearful mind imitates, accepts and obeys, which means that it will cease to function freely. A fearful mind is incapable of living completely, wholly, with an intensity of its own.


To be free of fear, you must first know that you are frightened. And, secondly, you must not run away from it; you must not escape from fear, but look at it.


In the same way, watch every fear that arises within you. Whether it is fear of a snake, fear of your parents, fear of an older boy, fear of your teacher, or fear in any other form, do not run away from it, but observe it, question it, find out what that


In the same way, watch every fear that arises within you. Whether it is fear of a snake, fear of your parents, fear of an older boy, fear of your teacher, or fear in any other form, do not run away from it, but observe it, question it, find out what that fear is. Watch your fear, and learn from it.


talking—you must not only question what you hear, but also observe your response to what you hear so that your mind will not be clouded by fear or prejudice and, therefore, will become sharp, clear, precise, reasonable, healthy.


But to have freedom is one of the most difficult things on earth. It means being free from fear, from ambition, from greed, from envy.


To love a child means seeing that he or she gets the right kind of education. To love a child means seeing that he or she is not made into a machine which merely repeats ideas learnt from a book, but is


To love a child means seeing that he or she gets the right kind of education. To love a child means seeing that he or she is not made into a machine which merely repeats ideas learnt from a book, but is helped to be intelligent.


They may have a lot of property, they may call themselves by big names but, inside, they have nothing, because they do not know how to see. I really mean this.


Just watch everything in life. Watching is a most extraordinary thing. Out of watching comes intelligence. If you know how to watch, you will not have to read all the complicated books on philosophy or religion. If you know how to look, how to listen, and how to speak, you will realize that it is all there in your own eyes, your own ears, and on your own tongue.


Look at your parents and teachers; notice how they talk to you, what kind of words they use. Do not criticize them, because nobody likes being criticized. Just watch them very objectively, without criticizing, without judging. If you can do this, they will know that you are watching and, as this watching has a big effect on people, they will begin to be a little more alert, a little less careless and untidy. It will also have a big effect on you. If you can observe and listen all the time during the whole day, you will find that both your body and your mind become very sensitive and, therefore, naturally disciplined. Discipline and sensitivity go together.


Then you will also find that you can live happily in this mad, stupid world with a few essential things, being neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, but tremendously alive; and from that will come the discovery of something much greater, something far beyond all this wanting and not-wanting.


France, Italy, Germany, China, and so on, and all these countries go on fighting each other, is that not a mad and stupid way to be? The earth is ours, yours and mine, and we have to live on it


France, Italy, Germany, China, and so on, and all these countries go on fighting each other, is that not a mad and stupid way to be? The earth is ours, yours and mine, and we have to live on it together; we have to cherish it and grow things in its soil, so that all the people in the world will have sufficient food, clothing and shelter.


What matters is what you are. What matters is how you live, what your feelings are—not at the particular moment when you go to a temple, or when you look at a picture which you consider God, but every day.


But outside this place there is a storm going on, a terrific storm of change. And, as you grow up, you will be thrown into that storm, and you will not know what to do. Therefore, you will carve out a little space for yourself, for your little family, and live there, rotting, quarrelling, bitter, unhappy, wanting more children, more money, more this and more that—and that will be all.


because it breeds wars, it breeds divisions, it breeds antagonism,


What is right?


You and I are both going to learn from your question. I am not going to instruct you, and you are not going to follow me. In discussing, both of us are going to learn. Do not control the mind when it wanders. I will tell you why. The mind wanders because it has innumerable interests. If you control the mind so as to concentrate on any one thing, you will build a resistance to all other things. That is not understanding. To understand, you have to explore every thought to its end. For example, if you think about a friend when you want to do something else, go into it and find out why you think about that friend; find out what the motives are. When other thoughts come, just ask these thoughts to wait while you go into the first thought. Your interest in finding out why the thought about your friend arose will bring about a quality of perception nor only with regard to that thought, but also with regard to all the other thoughts.


What happens, in the case of most of you, is that when there is an unpleasant thought, you say, ‘This is a terrible thought, so I must concentrate on the other thoughts’. This does not lead to the understanding of that thought. To understand that thought, you have to investigate it even though you consider it terrible. And, unless the mind is extraordinarily alert, it is very arduous to go into each thought, to enquire into and learn about it.


It is inward brutality to conform, to imitate, to be angry, jealous, ambitious, greedy. You can be free of this brutality only when you are fully aware of it all the time, and that requires a sharp, clear, precise and passionate mind.
