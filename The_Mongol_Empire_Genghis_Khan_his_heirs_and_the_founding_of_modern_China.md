For centuries Mongolia’s nomadic, herding traditions ensured that women matched men in self-reliance. They rode, they ruled, they fought.


Her name was Sorkaktani, and she should be better known, because she was the most remarkable woman of her age.


In Persia, in the mid-nineteenth century, the Nizari imam was appointed governor of Qum, with the new title of Agha Khan, which became hereditary from then on. The Agha Khan led his troops and family into Afghanistan, allied himself to the British and settled in Bombay, where he remained for the next thirty years, rebuilding his wealth and raising racehorses. The present imam, the Harvard-educated Agha Khan IV, ministers to a scattered community of some 15 million Nizaris through the Aga Khan Foundation in Switzerland and his headquarters near Paris; a surprising outcome for a sect whose extreme violence led to their near 


He was after all the spiritual head of all Islam; God was surely on his side. ‘O young man,’ he blustered, ‘do you not know that from the East to the Maghreb, all the worshippers of Allah, whether kings or beggars, are slaves to this court of mine?’ Empty words, as it turned out. Not even a beggar, let alone a king, came to help him.


when all China fell to the Mongols, this would become the capital of the whole united nation, and so it has remained. The heart of today’s Beijing, the Forbidden City, was built right over Kublai’s creation – destroyed after the end of Mongol rule – its entrance facing south, like the door of any Mongolian tent. The 800 palaces and halls, the 9,000 rooms, the entrance from Tiananmen Square – all these are where they are because Kublai chose to place his palace there.


And that opened the way to a world of spirits, in particular to a terrifying, black-faced, six-armed, skull-covered guardian-deity named Mahakala, revered by millions across Asia as the ‘Great Black One’. He is sometimes a manifestation of Shiva, the Destroyer, sometimes one of Shiva’s attendants. Like most Buddhist gods, he varies from culture to culture. In any event, it’s better to have him onside. Kublai adopted him as a ‘tutelary deity’, in the words of the eminent Mongolian historian Shagdaryn Bira. Kublai could ‘pretend to have acquired all his mysterious powers in the cause of ruling his empire. Thus the Mongolian khan could enjoy not only the favour of Tengri, but also the favour of the powerful Tantric god.’


In the late sixteenth century, when the Mongol tribes were constantly vying for supremacy, a Buddhist cleric being cultivated by the dominant khan of the day, Altan, declared Altan to be the reincarnation of Kublai; in return, Altan granted him the title Dalai Lama (dalai being Mongolian for ‘sea’, a traditional symbol of power). Thereafter, it was the Dalai Lama who ruled in Tibet, and remained ruling until 1959, when Mao invaded, ten years after his Communists had seized power.


As far as Mongols were concerned, it was Mongolia that conquered China, Mongolia that occupied Tibet, Mongolia that established a Mongol empire. Fortunately for China, Kublai decided to establish a Chinese dynasty, making his grandfather its posthumous founder, thus turning history upside down. In Chinese eyes, Genghis and Kublai and all their conquests were actually Chinese. And so therefore is Tibet.


ON HIS DEATH, Genghis ruled an empire four times the size of Alexander’s, twice the size of Rome’s, larger than any nation today except Russia. And it was only half complete. By 1300, the Mongols had doubled Genghis’s conquests, adding what is now the rest of China, Korea, Tibet, Pakistan, Iran, most of Turkey, the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), most of habitable Russia, Ukraine and half of Poland. They had probed western Europe, the borders of Egypt, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Japan. One sixth of the world’s land area was theirs; and all this in the space of three generations. The fact that one man, Genghis’s grandson Kublai, was nominal master of this vast estate is one of history’s most astonishing facts.


Many top Mongolians fawned on courtly fashion, took the royal coin, and forgot the simplicity and toughness of their nation’s founder.


The dreadful Timur claimed to be a Genghisid, though he wasn’t. He justified himself as a sort of reincarnation of Genghis – modest roots, heavenly favours, brutal conquests and so on. It was this false claim that explains why Timur’s descendant, Babur, called himself ‘Mughal’ when he seized power in India in the early sixteenth century, establishing a dynasty that ended when the British shuffled the last Mughal off the throne in 1857. His name, by the way, was Bahadur, a distant echo of the Mongol baatar, hero, the second element in Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar (Red Hero). Even today, we remember: a ‘mogul’, originally a wealthy Indian, then a wealthy Anglo-Indian, is now a tycoon.
