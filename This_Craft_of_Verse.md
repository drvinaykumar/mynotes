Thomas De Quincey wrote—in some of the thousands of pages of his fourteen volumes—that to discover a new problem was quite as important as discovering the solution to an old one.


library is a kind of magic cavern which is full of dead men. And those dead men can be reborn, can be brought to life when you open their pages.


Bishop Berkeley (who, may I remind you, was a prophet of the greatness of America), I remember he wrote that the taste of the apple is neither in the apple itself—the apple cannot taste itself—nor in the mouth of the eater. It requires a contact between them.


Bishop Berkeley (who, may I remind you, was a prophet of the greatness of America), I remember he wrote that the taste of the apple is neither in the apple itself—the apple cannot taste itself—nor in the mouth of the eater. It requires a contact between them. The same thing happens to a book or to a collection of books, to a library. For what is a book in itself? A book is a physical object in a world of physical objects. It is a set of dead symbols. And then the right reader comes along, and the words—or rather the poetry behind the words, for the words themselves are mere symbols—spring to life, and we have a resurrection of the word. I


It is a fact, indeed, that most of the great teachers of mankind have been not writers but speakers. Think of Pythagoras, Christ, Socrates, the Buddha, and so on.


dialogues of Plato, he speaks about books in a rather disparaging way: “What is a book? A book seems, like a picture, to be a living being; and yet if we ask it something, it does not answer. Then we see that it is dead.”2

And some of those dialogues come to no conclusion whatever, because Plato was thinking as he wrote them; he did not know the last page when he wrote the ~rst. He was letting his mind wander, and he was dramatizing that mind into many people. I suppose his chief aim was the illusion that, despite the fact that Socrates had drunk the hemlock, Socrates was still with him. I feel this to be true because I have had many masters in my life. I am proud to be a disciple—a good disciple, I hope.


Bernard Shaw (to whom I am always going back) was asked once whether he really thought the Bible was the work of the Holy Ghost. And he said, “I think the Holy Ghost has written not only the Bible, but all books.”


we have in English the verb “to tease”—a mischievous word. It means a kind of joke. Yet in Old English tesan meant “to wound with a sword,” even as in French navrer meant “to thrust a sword through somebody.” Then, to take a different Old English word, þreat, you may ~nd out from the very ~rst verses of Beowulf that it meant “an angry crowd”—that is to say, the cause of the “threat.” And thus we might go on endlessly.

So we have both cases: the case (I need hardly dwell upon it) when time debases a poem, when the words lose their beauty; and also the case when time enriches rather than debases a poem.


we make a very common mistake when we think that we’re ignorant of something because we are unable to de~ne it. If we are in a Chestertonian mood (one of the very best moods to be in, I think), we might say that we can de~ne something only when we know nothing about it.

arguments convince nobody. They convince nobody because they are presented as arguments. Then we look at them, we weigh them, we turn them over, and we decide against them.

god’s terrible face, brighter than a spoon, collects the image of one fatal word, so that my life (which liked the sun and the moon) resembles something that has not occurred.16 “Resembles something that has not occurred”: this line carries a kind of strange simplicity.

So I think that the outlook—even after my lecture—is quite good for the metaphor.

there were really two stories: the homecoming of Ulysses, and the marvels and perils of the sea. If we take the Odyssey in the ~rst sense, then we have the idea of homecoming, the idea that we are in banishment, that our true home is in the past or in heaven or somewhere else, that we are never at home.


It might be said that for many centuries, those three stories—the tale of Troy, the tale of Ulysses, the tale of Jesus—have been suf~cient for mankind. People have been telling and retelling them over and over again; they have been set to music; they have been painted. People have told them many times over, yet the stories are still there, illimitable.

If we think of the novel and the epic, we are tempted to fall into thinking that the chief difference lies in the difference between verse and prose, in the difference between singing something and stating something. But I think there is a greater difference. The difference lies in the fact that the important thing about the epic is a hero—a man who is a pattern for all men. While, as Mencken pointed out, the essence of most novels lies in the breaking down of a man, in the degeneration of character.

Nowadays when people talk of a happy ending, they think of it as a mere pandering to the public, or they think it is a commercial device; they think of it as arti~cial. Yet for centuries men could very sincerely believe in happiness and in victory, though they felt the essential dignity of defeat.


Think of the chief novels of our time—say, Joyce’s Ulysses.Weare told thousands of things about the two characters, yet we do not know them. We have a better knowledge of characters in Dante or Shakespeare, who come to us—who live and die—in a few sentences. We do not know thousands of circumstances about them, but we know them intimately. That, of course, is far more important.

I do not think that in India people have the historical sense. One of the thorns in the _esh of Europeans who write or have written histories of Indian philosophy is that all philosophy is seen as contemporary by the Indians. That is to say, they are interested in the problems themselves, not in the mere biographical fact or historical, chronological fact. That So-and-So was What’s-His-Name’s master, that he came before, that he wrote under that in_uence—all those things are nothing to them. They care about the riddle of the universe. I suppose, in a time to come (and I hope this time is around the corner), men will care for beauty, not for the circumstances of beauty. Then we will have translations not only as good (we have them already) but as famous as Chapman’s Homer, as Urquhart’s Rabelais, as Pope’s Odyssey.13 I think this is a consummation devoutly to be wished.

Let us consider a word such as “dreary”: the word “dreary” meant “bloodstained.” Similarly, the word “glad” meant “polished,” and the word “threat” meant “a threatening crowd.” Those words that now are abstract once had a strong meaning.


Stevenson thought— poetry is not trying to take a set of logical coins and work them into magic. Rather, it is bringing language back to its original source.

I have suspected many a time that meaning is really something added to verse. I know for a fact that we feel the beauty of a poem before we even begin to think of a meaning.


There are, of course, verses that are beautiful and meaningless. Yet they still have a meaning—not to the reason but to the imagination.


Hanslick said of music: I can recall it, I can understand it (not with the mere reason—with a deeper imagination); but I cannot translate it. And I do not think it needs any translation.

think the fact of having long catalogues of words and explanations makes us think that the explanations exhaust the words, and that any one of those coins, of those words, can be exchanged for another. But I think we know—and the poet should feel—that every word stands by itself, that every word is unique.

I have had the luck to possess many admirable friends, and there are many anecdotes told of them. Some of those anecdotes have—I am sorry to say, I am proud to say—been coined by myself. But they are not false; they are essentially true. De Quincey said that all anecdotes are apocryphal. I think that had he cared to go deeper into the matter, he would have said that they are historically apocryphal but essentially true. If a story is told of a man, then that story resembles him; that story is his symbol.

When I think of such dear friends of mine as Don Quixote, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Huckleberry Finn, Peer Gynt, and so on (I’m not sure I have many more friends), I feel that the men who wrote their histories were drawing the longbow,20 but that the adventures they evolved were mirrors or adjectives or attributes of those men. That is to say, if we believe in Mr. Sherlock Holmes, then we may look with derision on the hound of the Baskervilles; we need not fear him. So I say that what is important is our believing in a character.


I have spoken of several poets today, and I am sorry to say that in the last lecture I shall be speaking of a lesser poet—a poet whose works I never read, but a poet whose works I have to write. I shall speak of myself. And I hope that you will forgive me this quite affectionate anticlimax.


A POET’S CREED

For one reads what one likes— yet one writes not what one would like to write, but what one is able to write.


I have toyed with an idea—the idea that although a man’s life is compounded of thousands and thousands of moments and days, those many instants and those many days may be reduced to a single one: the moment when a man knows who he is, when he sees himself face to face.

Besides, we are modern by the very simple fact that we live in the present. Nobody has yet discovered the art of living in the past, and not even the futurists have discovered the secret of living in the future. We are modern whether we want to be or not. Perhaps the very fact of my attacking modernity now is a way of being modern.

(mere fact is a web of circumstances and accidents),


If I say to myself, for example, that Wordsworth and Verlaine were very good nineteenth-century poets, then I may fall into the danger of thinking that time has somehow destroyed them, that they are not as good now as they were. I think the ancient idea—that we might allow perfection to art without taking into account the dates—was a braver one.


I have read several histories of Indian philosophy. The authors (Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, Americans, and so on) always wonder at the fact that in India people have no historical sense—that they treat all thinkers as if they were contemporary. They translate the words of ancient philosophy into the modern jargon of today’s philosophy. But this stands for something brave. This stands for the idea that one believes in philosophy or that one believes in poetry—that things beautiful once can go on being beautiful still.

If I am joking now, I do so because I feel something within me. I am joking because I really feel what this means to me. I know that I shall look back on this night. I will wonder: Why did not I say what I should have said? Why did not I say what these months in America have meant to me—what all these unknown and known friends have meant to me? But I suppose that somehow my feeling is coming through to you. I
