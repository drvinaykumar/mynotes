Sāṅkhya occupies itself with the path of reasoning to attain liberation, specifically concerning the analysis of the manifold ingredients of prakṛti from which the puruṣa is to be extricated, and Yoga more with the path of meditation, focusing on the nature of mind and consciousness, and on the techniques of concentration in order to provide a practical method through which the puruṣa can be isolated and extricated.


The succinctness of the Yoga Sūtras—it contains about 1,200 words in 195 sūtras—indicates that they were construed to be a manual requiring unpacking. That the sūtras, or aphorisms, are in places cryptic, esoteric, and incomprehensible in their own terms points to the fact that they were intended to be used in conjunction with a teacher:


It is Vyāsa who determined what Patañjali’s abstruse sūtras meant, and all subsequent commentators elaborated on Vyāsa.


in Sāṅkhya and Yoga, thought, feeling, emotion, memory, etc., are as material or physical as the visible ingredients of the empirical world.1


In the Sāṅkhya (literally, numeration) system, the universe of animate and inanimate entities is perceived as ultimately the product of two ontologically distinct categories; hence this system is quintessentially dvaita, or dualistic in presupposition.


These two categories are prakṛti, or the primordial material matrix of the physical universe, “the undifferentiated plenitude of being,”13 and puruṣa, the innumerable conscious souls or selves embedded within it. As a result of the interaction between these two entities, the material universe evolves in stages. The actual catalysts in this evolutionary process are the three guṇas, literally, strands or qualities, that are inherent in prakṛti. These are sattva, lucidity; rajas, action; and tamas, inertia.


sattva (from the root as, “to be”15)


sattva (from the root as, “to be”15) is predominant in an individual, the qualities of lucidity, tranquillity, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, happiness, and peacefulness manifest; when rajas (from the root rañj, to color, to redden) is predominant, hankering, attachment, energetic endeavor, passion, power, restlessness, and creative activity manifest; and when tamas, the guṇa least favorable for yoga, is predominant, stillness, ignorance, delusion, disinterest, lethargy, sleep, and disinclination toward constructive activity manifest.


lucidity, tranquillity, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, happiness, and peacefulness manifest; when


air contains more of the buoyancy of sattva; stones, more of the sluggishness of the tamas element; and fire, more rajas (although its buoyancy betrays its partial nature of sattva as well).


according to classical Sāṅkhya,18 the first evolute emerging from prakṛti when it is churned by the guṇas (sattva specifically) is buddhi, intelligence. Intelligence is characterized by the functions of judgment, discrimination, knowledge, ascertainment, will, virtue, and detachment,19 and sattva is predominant in it.


From buddhi, ahaṅkāra, or ego, is produced (aham, I + kāra, doing; referred to as asmitā in this text). This is characterized by the function of self-awareness and

In other words, the ahaṅkāra of a bug acts almost like a concave screen that refracts consciousness to pervade and appropriate the contours of the bug. If the bug dies and becomes, say, a dog and then a human in subsequent lives, the ahaṅkāra aspect of the citta adjusts to accommodate and absorb consciousness into these new environments. Thus the bug thinks it is a bug, the dog thinks it is a dog, and the human thinks he or she is a human.


Buddhi, intelligence; ahaṅkāra, ego; and manas, mind, together comprise the internal body (antaḥkaraṇa), the inner noetic world of thoughts, emotions, feelings, determination, will, cognitions, memories, etc.


from the ego stirred by tamas emerge the tanmātras, or subtle elements—the energies or powers underpinning sound, sight, smell, taste, and touch. These are the generic energies behind the sensory powers, not specific sounds or varieties of tastes, etc., hence their name, tanmātra, only that (namely, the essences of these energies, not their particular individualized expressions).22 Since knowledge and illumination are qualities of sattva, the tanmātras are still very sāttvic in nature. These, in turn, sequentially produce the five mahābhūtas, or gross elements—ether, air, fire, water, and earth—the world of form, the actual physical, tangible stuff of the universe.


the effects of the world are present in their cause.


Gross matter is actually an evolute or derivative of something subtler, the subtle elements, and these of something subtler still, the ego, which is an evolute of buddhi, intelligence. This means buddhi underpins all reality, even as buddhi itself is a manifestation of prakṛti and the guṇas, or, put differently, any expression of reality, subjective or objective, is nothing other than a manifestation of the guṇas. These evolutes are all called tattvas, thatnesses; they are the real constituents of “that” world out there perceived by the self.


The citta can profitably be compared to the software, and the body to the hardware. Neither is conscious; they are rather forms of gross matter, even as the former can do very intelligent activities. Both software and hardware are useless without the presence of a conscious observer. Only puruṣa is truly alive, that is, aware or conscious.


(Ignorance is mysterious, since the question of how it comes to arise in the first place is bypassed by all Indic metaphysicians by stating that it is beginningless.


Vācaspati Miśra traces the etymology of yoga to one of the meanings of the root yuj, to contemplate,


The more established etymology from the perspective of modern historical linguistics is, of course, derived from the same Indo-European root as the English word “yoke.”9 Yoga can thus mean that which joins, that is, unites one with the Absolute Truth, and while this translation of the term is popularly found (and may be apt in other contexts, such as the Gītā, IX.3410), it is best avoided in the context of the Yoga Sūtras, since, as was pointed out over a hundred years ago by the famous Indologist Max Müller (1899, 309ff) (and long before that, by the sixteenth-century Indian doxographer Mādhava11) the goal of yoga is not to join, but the opposite: to unjoin, that is, to disconnect puruṣa from prakṛti.12 If the term is to mean “yoke,” it entails yoking the mind on an object of concentration without deviation.


when the mind is directed toward an object, it can manifest five different degrees of focus (bhūmis): wondering, confused, distracted, concentrated, and restrained. It is the last two that are of interest to Yoga: when the mind, citta, is restrained and concentrated, or fixed on one point,


persona.


persona.22 At death, the soul discards the gross body (which returns to the material elements, to “dust”) but remains encapsulated in the subtle body, which is retained from life to life, and eventually attains a new gross body, in accordance with natural laws (karma, etc.).

Just as a person with a torch in hand gives up the torch upon finding treasure, says Vijñānabhikṣu, so, eventually, the intellect, and the knowledge that it presents, also become redundant upon attaining the ultimate source of truth, puruṣa, the soul and innermost self.


In


In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad, for example, “yoga is believed to be when the senses are firmly under control” (VI.11), while in the karma-yoga (path of action) section of the Bhagavad Gītā, yoga is defined as samatvam, evenness of mind (II.48) and as karmasu kauśalam, skill in action (II.50). Elsewhere, the text defines yoga as duḥkha-saṁyoga-viyogam, separation from union with pain (VI.23),


According to Patañjali’s definition in this sūtra, yoga is the cessation (nirodha) of the permutations or activities (vṛttis) of the citta.


in Sāṅkhya, ultimate reality is perceived as the product of two distinct ontological categories: prakṛti, or the primordial material matrix of the physical universe, and puruṣa, pure awareness, the innermost conscious self or soul (the terms “consciousness” and “awareness,” although problematic,28 will be used interchangeably in this commentary to refer to the nature of the puruṣa). As a result of the contact between these two distinct entities, prakṛti and puruṣa, the material universe evolves in a sequential fashion.


it is buddhi that molds itself into the forms of the data funneled to it by manas, below, and presents these images to the puruṣa soul, to which it is immediately adjacent.


Ahaṅkāra, or ego,32 produces the function of thought related to self-awareness, self-identity, and self-conceit


personal pronoun aham means I, and kāra, the doer).


It also delimits awareness, which is potentially omnipresent,33 and refracts it to fit into the contours of the particular body and mind within which it finds itself.


Manas, the mind, is the aspect of citta that engages in the functions of thought especially related to organizing sensory input and directing the senses;


As the village chief collects rent from the heads of the families and presents it to the district chief, who delivers it to the chief superintendent, who delivers it to the king, so the sense organs, having perceived an external object, deliver it to the mind, who considers it and delivers it to the ego, who appropriates it and delivers it to the intelligence, the chief superintendent of all. Thus it is said “they present it to intelligence, [thereby] illuminating the purpose of the puruṣa.“


vṛt means to revolve, turn, proceed, move,


The sense objects provide images that are received through the senses, sorted by the manas, the thinking and organizing aspect of citta, and presented to the intellect. Although inanimate, the intellect molds itself into the form and shape of these objects of experience, thoughts, and ideas. Vijñānabhikṣu compares this process to liquid copper being poured into a mold and taking the exact shape of the mold, although the forms into which buddhi is molded are extremely subtle and psychic in nature.


The Mahābhārata states that as one can light thousands of lamps from one lamp, so prakṛti can produce hundreds of thousands of transformations of the guṇas (XII, 301, 15–16).


guṇas.43 Kṛṣṇa makes the useful observation that the guṇas are in continual tension with each other, one guṇa becoming prominent in an individual for a while and suppressing the others, only to be dominated in turn by the emergence of one of the other guṇas (Bhagavad Gītā XIV.10).


sattva is the guṇa most conducive—indeed, indispensable—to the yogic enterprise, but while rajas and tamas are universally depicted as obstacles to yoga, a certain amount of each guṇa is indispensable to embodied existence. Without tamas, for example, there would be no sleep; without rajas, no digestion or even the energy to blink an eye.


The etymological meaning of sattva is the nature of being.


it is sattva that can reveal matter for what it is before rajas and tamas cause it to transform.


When lead is burned with gold, says Bhoja Rāja, it not only burns away the impurities in gold, but burns itself away too;


For Buddhists, when the objects of consciousness are removed, so is consciousness. There is thus no ultimate, eternal, essential entity such as a puruṣa, soul, that is separable from an object of consciousness; indeed, clinging to such notions of an autonomous self is the very cause of saṁsāra.


“As a dancer ceases from the dance after having been seen by the audience, so also prakṛti ceases after having manifested herself to the puruṣa”


As the Buddha is reputed to have said, if a man is shot by an arrow, it is useless to inquire as to the nature of the arrow, its point of origin, etc.


One should more profitably first remove the arrow.58


One should more profitably first remove the arrow.58 Likewise, for one drowning in the ocean of birth and death, saṁsāra, it is fruitless to speculate as to how one originally fell in; it would be more productive to find first a means to get out. Such a means, of course, is yoga.


karma refers not only to an initial act, whether benevolent or malicious, but also to the reaction it produces


This cycle of action and reaction, or saṁsāra, is potentially eternal and unlimited since not only does any one single act breed a reaction, but the actor must then react to this reaction, causing a rereaction, which in term fructifies and provokes rerereactions, and so on ad infinitum.


other words, for the novice struggling to control his or her mind, even if the emergence of sattva occurs only periodically, it is always a beneficial occurence, and it can be gradually increased and strengthened by a yogic lifestyle. The reverse also holds true, adds Vyāsa: Detrimental vṛttis also can surface periodically in a predominantly sāttvic citta (hence the Gītā’s statement in II.60 that the senses can carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination).


For example, a particular type of experience, say smoking a cigarette, is imprinted in the citta as a saṁskāra, which then activates as a desirable memory or impulse, provoking a repetition of this activity, which is likewise recorded, and so on until a cluster or grove of saṁskāras of an identical or similar sort is produced in the citta, gaining strength with each repetition. The stronger or more dominant such a cluster of saṁskāras becomes, the more it activates and imposes itself upon the consciousness of the individual, demanding indulgence and perpetuating a vicious cycle that can be very hard to break. The reverse, of course, also holds true with benevolent akliṣṭa-vṛttis: One can become addicted, so to speak, to benevolent yogic activities and lifestyle by constant repetition. Kleśas, vṛttis, saṁskāras, and karma are thus all interconnected links in the chain of saṁsāra.


9.   Interestingly, all the Upaniṣads wherein Yoga is expressed belong to the same Vedic branch, that of the black Yajur Veda.


the tanmātras can be considered the universals, sāmānya, of sound, taste, etc., rather than individuators, viśeṣa, of particular notes of the scale, range of tastes, etc.


enumerate six schools of thought that emerged from the Upaniṣadic period of the late Vedic age (although, as noted in the introduction, the first textual reference to such six schools can be attested only very late). Among these, the Mīmāṁsā school, noteworthy for its treatment of epistemology, formulated a rationale for perpetuating the old Vedic sacrificial rites. The Nyāya school was best known for developing rules of logic so that the debates between the various schools could be conducted according to conventions about what constituted valid argument. The Vaiśeṣika school provided a metaphysics that perceived the created world as ultimately consisting of the combination of various eternal categories such as subatomic particles. The Sāṅkhya school posited a contrasting metaphysical system in which the created world evolved out of primordial matter, prakṛti, from which the puruṣa, soul, must extricate itself. The Vedānta school was concerned less with the physical constituents of the material world and more with the relationship among Brahman, the Supreme Truth of the Upaniṣads; ātman, the individualized feature of Brahman; and the perceived world as an emanation of Brahman. Finally, the Yoga school as represented by Patañjali is less a philosophical school than a practical psychosomatic technique through which the puruṣa—the ātman of the Upaniṣads—can be realized as distinct from prakṛti. As noted in the introduction, Yoga referred to a cluster of meditative techniques, some form of which was common to numerous different schools and sects, rather than a distinct philosophical school.


Brahmā, the secondary creator god of Hinduism, is said to have uttered atha along with oṁ in the beginning of creation


in certain Vedānta traditions where the ātman might be conceived as uniting with Brahman, in the Yoga tradition, ātman (puruṣa) does not come into contact with anything other than itself, and hence union is problematic, unless used very loosely. Second, yoga is more accurately a process of disunion, that is, of puruṣa breaking its union with prakṛti rather than uniting with anything.


mind is overcome primarily by tamas, it becomes inclined to vice, ignorance, attachment, and impotence, and when it is overcome primarily by rajas, it becomes inclined to the opposite types of qualities.


This is perhaps the most essential metaphysical difference between Hindu (and Jain) traditions and Buddhist ones.
